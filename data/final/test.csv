"While electrons and protons masses are very different, but they have the same charge magnitude (measured by the SI unit coulomb), which is why their charges balance out when they're in equal quantities in an atom.",Proton,Why/how do electrons have enough charge to negate the effects of protons?
"Being allosteric lets people know that the inhibitor binds somewhere other than the active site, where the substrate binds. The location that the allosteric inhibitor binds is called the allosteric site. Because it isn't competing for the same binding site as the substrate, people can tell that it is non-competitive as the substrate will still be able to bond at the active site.",Allosteric regulation,Is allosteric inhibitor non-competitive or competitive?
The lac operon creates the enzymes required to metabolise the lactose. A presence of lactose would need the production of such enzymes.,Lactose,Why does body make more lactose?
Entropy is not exactly disorder it is the sum of all possible states of the given system.,Entropy,Then why does entropy not mean messy?
"In order for a virus to infect a cell, it must bring its DNA or RNA into contact with the host cell. Infection requires that the virus get through the cellular membrane. Some viruses remain outside the cell. They attach to the membrane at specific receptor sites. Once attached the virus injects its DNA or RNA into the cell. Enveloped viruses are enclosed in a membrane similar to that of the host cell. The virus and the envelope fuse and the virus enters the cell through endocytosis.",Virus,How do viruses and bacteria get into a cell and corrupt them?
"a subgroup is a group of related species in the same genus. A subspecies is a group of organisms that are in the species but are different in some way (like a bengal tiger vs a siberian tiger). If two populations of the same species were separated by a geographical event (like a canyon), then they would begin different evolutionary paths. After thousands of years they might start to look a bit different but would still be part of the same species - you could call them subspecies!",Subspecies,Does allopatric speciation make subgroups or subspecies?
"O2 has greater oxidative power (thus energy) than CO2. this has a lot to do about the links between molecules. CH4 has a lot of links, but low energetic. anabolic and catabolic are talking mostly about monomers becoming polymers... or side chains being added or removed. when you get down to the level of elemental oxygen and carbon forming carbon dioxide",Oxygen,Is reaction that oxygen reacts with carbon to create CO2 anabolic or catabolic?
"for analyzing DNA, it is best to have many copies of the DNA they will behave the same anyways, and it is easier to see them for analysis. so it makes sense to use the Polymerase Chain Reaction to prepare for Gel electrophoresis",Gel electrophoresis,Does gel electrophoresis work?
"The ribosomes are reversibly attached to the outer surface of the membrane rather than being inserted into the membrane. The proteins produced by ER-bound ribosomes start with what are known as a signal sequence$ and are initiated within the cytosol - the signal sequence then directs the complex of peptide, mRNA, and ribosome to dock with the ER. ",Ribosome,Does that mean that ribosomes are actually in between the two phospholipid bilayers of the nuclear envelope?
"Both have hydrogen bonding, but propan-1-ol has higher London dispersion forces. Its molecules are linear, so they can approach each other more closely than molecules of propan-2-ol can.",Hydrogen bond,Don't both have hydrogen bonding?
"As a cell grows in size, the surface area gets bigger, but the volume gets bigger faster. Thinking about this as a ratio (division), the volume is the denominator and the surface area is the numerator. If the volume is getting very big, then the ratio itself will be getting very small. What this translates to is as a cell gets larger, with a larger volume, it has a smaller SA:V. A smaller SA:V means that diffusion of nutrients and diffusion of waste in less efficient (harder to do). The rate of diffusion doesn't change, but it would take longer for the nutrients to diffuse through to the centre of the cell than a cell with a higher SA:V (a smaller cell - i.e. a cell with a smaller volume)",Surface area,What does surface area have to do with how much energy it takes for these transfers to occur?
"If you look at the periodic table, you can see Cadmium (Cd) belongs to the 12th group. The periodic table is organized so that the 2 in '12' is equivalent to the amount of electrons the element has in its valence shell. That means Cadmium has 2 electrons in its valence shell. An atom of Cadmium has an oxidation of 2+ because it tends to lose those 2 electrons in its valence shell in order to stabilize, therefore having a positive charge of 2",Cadmium,"How can cadmium, an element that is somewhere around the middle of the periodic table, have an oxidation state of +2?"
"The hydrogen atoms are sharing, not the oxygen atom. The hydrogen atoms each have a slight + charge and the oxygen atom has a slight - charge. ",Oxygen,How would oxygen share the electrons with the two hydrogens?
"the difference is that the ring has aromatic stabilization, while the benzylic position does not. This means that removing a benzylic hydrogen results in a smaller energy gain (and thus requires less energy) that removing a ring hydrogen, since the latter destroys the aromaticity of the ring.",Hydrogen,"Why not just losing a Hydrogen on the ring itself, as it can be resonance stabilized in the exact same way?"
"The entropy of a macro-system is proportional to the number of micro-states the system can be in that are compatible with the macro-state of the system. To make this notion precise, one has to specify the definition of macro-states and micro-states and how the micro-states will be counted. Sal is not providing those details here, but is speaking more qualitatively. Still, the entropy increase with either volume increase or temperature increase can be understood at this qualitative level. The micro-state of a gas is given by the location and velocity of each molecule in the gas. If the volume increases, the molecules have more locations they can be at, hence more micro-states. If the temperature increases, the molecules have more velocities with which they can move, hence more micro-states. Remember that absolute temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules, so increasing temperature increases the range of velocities the molecules are likely to have. This is an increase in the number of micro-states.",Temperature,How come an increase in temperature increases this combination of states?
"anything could react with anything _spontaneously_ under the right conditions (for many reactions these conditions would be hard to meet, and the substances would have to be at the right temperature too). Basically, under the right conditions, if you put two substances together they react without any outside help (i.e. without any added energy).",Chemical reaction,Could anything react with anything?
"In the prokaryotic bacteria, Flagella is an organ as it is the only mode of locomotion and performs other functions like excretion. Due to multiple functions it has further importance. It also acts as a sensory organ",Flagellum,Why does flagella is not an organelle?
"Electrons have the properties of being both particles and waves so, in terms of their wave properties, it's not meaningful to refer to them being on opposite sides of an axis. They occupy the entire orbital.",Electron,Why assuming that if two electrons are in the same orbital they will be next to each other?
"If the mirror image of a molecule is just the molecule itself, but rotated, then that mirror image is NOT an enantiomer: it is the same molecule. the molecule is not chiral (it is achiral)",Molecule,Does the molecule still remains chiral?
"We determine the oxidation state by an agreed upon set of rules. It is just a record keeping system. It is very, very helpful, which is why we use it, but it is still just a group of rules. There are a great many chemicals that for which the oxidation state rules tell use a great deal, but there are also some chemicals where the oxidation state rules don't really help much at all. Here are the rules: (0) Oxidation states can only be integers. (1) the oxidation state of a free element (uncombined element) is 0. There are no exceptions. (2) for a simple (monatomic) ion, the oxidation state is equal to the net charge on the ion. (3) Except in its elemental state, fluorine always has −1. There are no exceptions. (4) Except in its elemental sate, hydrogen has +1, except in hydrides of active metals, e.g. LiH, where it as an oxidation state of −1 (5) Oxygen has a state of −2 except in peroxides and superoxides where it has a state of −1 or when combined with fluorine in which case it has whatever state is needed not to contradict the rule that fluorine must be −1 (usually oxygen will be +2 with fluorine). (6) the algebraic sum of oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule must be zero, while in ions the algebraic sum of the oxidation states of the constituent atoms must be equal to the charge on the ion. (7) Group 1 elements, except in the elemental state, have +1 (8) Group 2 elements, except in the elemental state, have +2 (9) Chlorine, bromine, and iodine, except in the elemental state, have −1 states except where that contradicts the rules for oxygen and fluorine. In compounds containing only chlorine, bromine and/or iodine (e.g. BrCl) then the lower atomic number element will have −1 and the higher atomic number element will have whatever is necessary not to contradict other rules (usually +1).",Oxidation state,How to determine the oxidation state of oxygen?
"Since a catalyst is not used up in a reaction, you only need a small amount (a lot less than stoichiometric ammounts). Catalysts speed up the rate of reaction, but they do not alter the position of equilibrium of a reaction. If without the catalyst your reaction would go to completion(all to products), even if very slowly, then yes, in the presence of catalysts, the reactants will all be turned into products. But if the reaction you are catalysing doesn't go to completion anyway, then the catalyst won't change that. This is because a catalyst increases both the rate of the forward and back reaction",Reagent,Will it work until all reactants are turned into products?
"Evolution is the change in which traits appear how often in a population, which can eventually cause one species to give rise to another. Natural selection is the major,mechanism by which evolution takes place. Given the environmental conditions and the competition for resources and mates that occur in a population, there is a filtering process called natural selection that takes place.",Evolution,Where does evolution occur in nature?
"An atom may donate an electron and attain octet configuration or it may gain electron and attain octet configuration. It is also possible that the atom shares its electron(as in O2) and attain stability. The bond formed by donating or gaining electron is called ionic bond. The bond formed by sharing of electrons is called covalent bond Hope that helped. There are three types of bond. The nonpolar covalent bond is when the electrons are equally shared between the two atoms and don't have a preference. Then there is the polar covalent bond like in water, where the electrons are still shared between the two atoms but shows a preference to the more electronegative atom (oxygen), because oxygen simply has a stronger tendency to attract electrons than the hydrogen does. Finally, there is an ionic bond where the difference in electronegativity is so great that it is no longer sharing electrons. In the case of an ionic bond, chlorine steals an electron (or sodium loses an electron) because of the tendency to fill its valence shell to its full configuration for both atoms. All three bonds are equally possible for stability between the two atoms, but the ionic bond is the special bond that involves a complete transfer of electrons.",Electron,Do the atoms share the electrons (and therefore form a bond)?
The germ cells are the simply the cells whose role it is to produce the sex cells. They are differentiated from somatic cells in the early embryo but they need to migrate and expand via mitosis before some of them form the sex cells. ,Mitosis,How the germ cell can go through mitosis?
"The Cl- is surrounded by water molecules which all have their partially positive H ends toward it. The water molecules don't bond with the Cl- like they do with the H+, though.",Chloride,Does the Cl conjugate base hang out by itself?
"A mixed vein of blood flows through the capillaries of the lungs,PO2 in the blood is lower than the alveoli PO2, while PCO2 in the blood is higher than the alveoli PCO2, The O2 in the alveoli spreads to the blood,the CO2 in the blood spreads to thealveoli.",Carbon dioxide,What makes the carbon dioxide go into the alveoli and the oxygen go into the capillary?
"Neutron emission is a common form of decay. it typically occurs in high neutron count isotopes, which don't occur very often in nature. Alpha radiation consists of 2x Neutrons and 2x Protons, e.g. a helium nucleus. So yes, a neutron can escape the nucleus - in the form of Alpha radiation.",Neutron,Is neutron only the proton which gets kicked out?
"1.Duplicated chromosomes are identical to each other, more accurately we call them *sister chromatids*and two sister chromatids together is one chromosome. However, homologous chromosomes are two chromosomes with different versions of genes. One homologous pair contain two chromosomes. 2. For example, if you are a male, then your sex chromosome would be XY so during interphase your X chromosome and Y chromosome would be doubled. So when the somatic cell goes in to the mitosis stage, the X and Y sister chromatids would be separated, resulting in each one X and Y chromosome again in each daughter cell. That's why your cells in your body all have XY chromosomes. In meiosis, crossing over also happens at sex chromosomes but the region where the crossing over would happen is limited and it is called pseudoautosomal region. But overall the crossing over would not harm the function of sex chromosomes. One thing meiosis is different from mitosis is that if you are a male, your four haploid daughter cells would have two each contain one X chromosome and the other two each contain one Y chromosome, meaning none of your gamete has a complete pair of sex determine chromosome like XX or XY.",Meiosis,Someone pl meiosis and mitosis with respect to X chromosome?
"Every water molecule dissociates into OH and H+ atoms, same goes vice versa ion condensation. H+ comes from another sugar molecule, attached to oxygen in the OH- group. In condensation reaction you got water molecule from 2 0H groups: but one H+ has to stay within C and create a glycosidic bond. The other H+ and OH- create H2O.",Hydron (chemistry),What is that extra H+ doing there on the head of water?
"In the face of an infection, cytokines and amongst other chemical signals are what draws immune cells to the bacteria. cells and bacterium don't have eyes or sensory organs, they sort of just float around until something pops up.",Bacteria,"Do cells 'hunt' for bacterium, or it's an occasion?"
"Both H atoms will have the same electronegativity, which is a long word with the simple meaning of the ability of an atom to attract electrons to itself. Since both H atoms will have same electronegativity, they will pull each other's electrons with the same force. For an ionic bond to occur, the H atom which will accept the electron must pull the other atom's electrons more strongly than the other atom pulls its electrons. In other words, ionic H-H bond is possible only if the two hydrogen atoms have different electronegativity, which is absurd, as they are exactly the same atoms.",Ionic bonding,Could diatomic hydrogen also be formed by an ionic bond?
"A negative delta thetaHf does mean energy is released when the atoms bond, a positive thetaHf does mean energy is required for the atoms to bond. If it were on the reactants side then it's saying the reaction would require energy.",Energy,Why does a positive kJ result end up with energy leaving a system?
"Oxidation implies an increase in oxidation number. Oxygen has an oxidation number of -2, and usually goes up to 0, making it oxidized (an element always has an oxidation number of 0, therefore O2 has an oxidation number of 0, thus increasing its oxidation number since 0 > -2 --> oxygen is oxidized). And by the way, Oxygen doesn't gain electrons, it loses them. Oxygen is a nonmetal with a charge of -2 in its ionic state. So in order to satisfy the octet rule, it loses its two valence electrons in the valence shell!",Oxygen,How can the oxygen being oxidised?
"That would depend on the species that was collapsing. If it was a minor organism, as in one that affected an organism with many other options for energy, the chance of that happening is very low. However, if it was a crucial organism that played a large part in energy sharing for that ecosystem, there could be a possibility of collapse. Once an ecosystem collapses, it is very hard, if not impossible, for it to recover. There might be some ways of restoring the ecosystem, but most ideas, like bringing in invasive species, either don't work or do the opposite of what was planned.",Ecosystem collapse,Would the entire ecosystem collapse?
"A virus reproduces by hijacking a cell, taking over its machinery, and forcing it to make new viruses. When the poor cell has made so many new viruses that it is completely filled with them, the viruses burst the cell's wall and escape. This kills the cell. The new viruses then float off to hijack more cells. Instead of hijacking just any old cell it runs into, the HIV virus specifically targets immune cells.",HIV,Why the HIV virus is coming out of the immune cell?
"humans are apes. it would be more accurate to say that all apes and humans share a common ancestor instead of saying that humans evolved from apes. This common ancestor doesn't exist anymore because over time the traits found in a population changed and became what we see today in the diversity of ape populations. So, if you could mate a human with an ape you would end up with a hybrid, but that hybrid wouldn't necessarily be anything like the common ancestor. Also, because humans and other apes are different species it might not be possible to mate the two and even if it was most people would find it unethical. Although it isn't quite the same because it doesn't deal with heredity a similar idea would be that raisins and grape juice share a common ancestor, at some time in the past they were both grapes. If you mix together raisins and grape juice you don't really get grapes.",Ape,"Human evolve from apes, so if one mated with a human?"
"To form ionic bonds, Carbon molecules must either gain or lose 4 electrons &This is highly unfavorable. therefore, carbon molecules share their 4 valence electrons through single, double, and triple bonds so that each atom can achieve noble gas configurations。",Ionic bonding,Why doesn't carbon form any ionic bond?
"H+ ions do not exist in water. They would be attracted to one of the two lone pairs of any water molecule and forming the hydronium ion. If the pH is acidic, they would remain as hydronium ions. However, the the OH ion released from the other sucrose molecule would be attracted to the hydronium which makes the solution again neutral.",Hydronium,"Didn't the H+ get randomly picked up by the OH and then later the OH group attached to Carbon gave up its hydrogen to H2O, making it H3O+?"
"The Calvin cycle is dependent on the Light-dependent reactions, and almost in the same way Light-dependent reactions are dependent on 'The Calvin Cycle'. The 'light-dependent reactions' receive light, and provide energy for the Calvin cycle. After used by the Calvin cycle, the molecules go back to the thylakoids to be reenergized in a way. So it is almost like a constant cycle between the two areas.",Calvin cycle,Does the Calvin cycle happen after the light-dependent reactions occurs or is the Calvin cycle independent?
"The heart is crucial in ensuring that the body receives the nutrients and oxygen it needs, while also disposing of waste.The heart is a pump cannot work without also having this mechanism as well,it is also composed of cells itself.",Oxygen,How do the contracting and expanding muscles gets oxygen?
"the air we breath holds nitrogen, oxygen, carbondioxide and trace gases. There is much more oxygen around then there is carbondioxide. ",Oxygen,Does the body extract the oxygen from the carbon dioxide?
"When an element is bonded to another atom of itself, that contribute 0 to its oxidation state. So, in other words, you just ignore the bond an atom makes to another atom of itself. So, in hydrogen peroxide we have: H-O-O-H. The O-O bond doesn't count. So each O is bonded to one H. Since H has an oxidation state of +1, O must cancel that out, so its oxidation number is −1.",Oxygen,Does the oxygen bonded with another oxygen don't count as another oxidation state?
"Hydrogen bonds do not take very much energy to break. The hydrogen bond is a weak attraction between molecules, or parts of larger molecules to each other caused by regional polarization resulting from hydrogen's very small diameter and relatively low electronegativity. ",Hydrogen bond,Why are hydrogen bonds called weak bonds?
"Markovnikov's original rule dealt with the addition of HX to an alkene. A more modern statement of his rule is, 'When an unsymmetrical reagent adds to an unsymmetrical alkene, the more positive part of the reagent adds to the carbon bearing more hydrogen atoms.' The more positive part of the reagent, the CHCl+ end of the growing chain, is always adding to the end of the chloroethene that has more hydrogen atoms. So, the reaction follows Markovnikov's rule.",Markovnikov's rule,Doesn't that violate Markovnikov's rule that the more substituted C will bond with the more substituted reactant?
"The hydrogen atoms are sharing, not the oxygen atom. The hydrogen atoms each have a slight + charge and the oxygen atom has a slight - charge. This is sometimes indicated on a dot structure with arrows.",Oxygen,How would oxygen share the electrons with the two hydrogens?
"photon frequency are exact. The precision must be extremely high - within the bounds of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. You might as well just say it has to be exact. If there's not a precise match, the photon will not be absorbed. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the energy levels are not exact unless the uncertainty in the time (lifetime of the excited state) is infinite. Of greater practical importance are two factors which give rise to non-zero line widths (the widths at half-height of the line profiles): (1) the Doppler effect, since atoms moving toward you will appear to emit light of slightly higher frequencies (a blue shift) whereas atoms moving away from you will appear to emit light of slightly lower frequencies (a red shift), and this effect becomes more pronounced at higher temperatures, since the average speeds of the molecules becomes greater, and (2) pressure broadening, since atoms or molecules colliding with each other have electrons with motions perturbed from their state in isolated atoms or molecules.",Electron,"Does the electron go into an energy level 1/100000 higher, or where does the extra energy go?"
"Passive transport basically does not require any form of energy compared to active transport. In the case of osmosis,the water moves from areas of HIGH WATER concentration to areas of LOW WATER concentration, which makes it a form of passive transport. It uses no energy to move, it just drifts into lower concentrations of WATER. WATER not other materials, only WATER. Osmosis deals with water.",Passive transport,Why would osmosis be a form of Passive Transport?
"The states of matter depend on two things, pressure, and temperature. If the temperate increases than the general energy increases and the molecules break away from each other thus causing the element to change to a higher state of matter, such as from liquid to gas. But the same is true with pressure except in a different way. If the pressure exerted on water is increased the molecules are squished together and it changes to a solid, but if the pressure is decreased the molecules are ""pulled apart"" and the state changes to a gas without the temperature having to change at all.",Temperature,How is water supposed to evaporate at 25 degrees Celsius?
"Potential energy comes from interaction with a charge, be it mass (gravity), electric charge (electric potential), weak or strong nuclear forces. by reducing intermolecular interaction to zero, and recognizing that the mass of a gas molecule is so tiny as to render gravity negligble, the molecules have no potential energy.",Potential energy,Whats causes a molecule to have potential energy?
"the water at the bottom of the container is less dense, the surface of the water is more dense because of surface tension, the water basically compacts on itself because the water molecules would like to take up the least amount of surface area possible.although the water at the surface is more dense, which allows for the paper clip to sink, on a molecular level, the bottom of the water, is barely less dense than the surface, which is why the paper clip does not float once underneath the surface of the water, and keeps sinking.",Paper clip,"Why does a paperclip that is able to sink below the surface, go down to the bottom?"
"In animals, which do cellular respiration and obtain glucose form food, oxygen consumption is directly correlated with metabolic rate. Anaerobic respiration jumps into the scene for extensive and intensive metabolic activities (such as running) when your energy consumption skyrockets. That also contributes to metabolic rate and has more prolonged effects (built up of lactic acid in muscles).",Anaerobic respiration,Does anaerobic respiration contribute to metabolic rate?
"One way people can tell between the redox reaction is when people see charges on the chemical equations. If the charges don't balance, people have to assume this is a redox reaction and go through specific steps to balance the equation. The electron transfer does occur in regular chemical reactions but the charges would balance on both sides.",Redox,How would people know if it is redox or a regular one?
"When tryptophan levels are low the tryptophan unbinds from tryptophan repressor, which allows transcription of the genes. most chemical reactions (including tryptophan binding as co-repressor to tryptophan repressor) have an equilibrium. In biology, you are typically shown one gene, one repressor, one co-repressor. But you have to imagine the vast majority of biological processes involve 100,000 e.coli cells, each with hundreds or thousands of tryptophan repressor molecules. The more tryptophan present, the more likely it is to bind to one of those repressors and inhibit (reduce) transcription of the gene. The less tryptophan present, the less likely it will bind to the repressor.",Repressor,Does the co-repressor unbind itself from the repressor?
Unless an inhibitor is irreversible (usually this involves making a covalent bond with the substate) the binding will reaction will be an equilibrium.The binding in non-competitive inhibition is reversible. ,Enzyme inhibitor,Is it possible for the inhibitor to later separate or unbind?
"Gel electrophoresis uses a constant voltage to make the DNA segments move because DNA has a negative charge so it moves towards the anode at different rates. The smaller segments move faster. Then, scientist stops the voltage once the segments moved far enough to distinguish them. using the DNA ladder they can find the size of the molecule. molecular-weight size marker, also referred to as a protein ladder, DNA ladder, or RNA ladder, is a set of standards that are used to identify the approximate size of a molecule run on a gel during electrophoresis.",DNA,How the exact length of DNA molecules can be determined when it is moving?
spontaneity of the reaction can be determined from the sign of the gibbs (free) energy. if dG0 reaction is spontaneous in backward direction (from right to left). if reaction is spontaneous in one direction it is non spontaneous in opposite direction.,Spontaneous process,Is a non spontaneous reaction always a reverse reaction?
"Polysaccharides are part of the cell membrane. They function in cell adhesion (holding cells together). They also form what is called the glycocalyx, which is like the cell's fingerprint. It allows other cells to recognize the cell as a similar cell or a different, invasive cell. Carbohydrates also have some other functions when attached to proteins and lipids, but these are the two major functions.",Carbohydrate,How carbohydrates fit into the fluid mosaic molecule and what do they look like?
"the water at the bottom of the container is less dense, the surface of the water is more dense because of surface tension, the water basically compacts on itself because the water molecules would like to take up the least amount of surface area possible. although the water at the surface is more dense, which allows for the paper clip to sink, on a molecular level, the bottom of the water, is barely less dense than the surface, which is why the paper clip does not float once underneath the surface of the water, and keeps sinking.",Water,What happens to the water at the bottom of the container?
The ions can flow freely in both directions through the solution in the salt bridge. ,Salt bridge,What stop the salt bridge from itself building up charge?
"Transmembrane proteins are held in the membrane by hydrophobic interactions between the protein and the phospholipid 'tails'. In most cases they can diffuse around the cell, but will not under normal circumstances leave the membrane. Some transmembrane proteins are anchored to the cytoskeleton, to other cells, or to the extracellular matrix. This means these proteins are not as free to move. An example of this are 'cell adhesion molecules', which help hold animals cells together and also anchor the cytoskeleton.",Protein,Do the proteins have a chance of going into the cell?
"That question is answered already: 'rocks help in the formation of landforms,which later will be used by animals to live so indirectly rocks affect the ecosystem' But rock even affects the ecosystem that animal might stub his'her toe on the rock and the wound get infected, eventually killing the animal",Rock music,How does the rock effect the community?
"When something is being oxidised by another thing, the another thing is the oxidising agent. When one thing is an oxidising agent, the other reactant in the reaction is the reducing agent.",Redox,"Does that mean that oxygen is the oxidation agent, and hydrogen would be the reduction agent?"
"There are three types of capillaries in our body - continuous, fenestrated and sinusoid. The major difference n these three types are that continuous capillaries are less permeable than fenestrated, having sinusoid to be the most permeable and big-sized capillaries in our body. Apparently, the main functions of these types vary accordingly with the permeability of the vessels and for sinusoid, as it is the largest capillary, allows larger molecules to flow through it, including white blood cells of any kind. Another idea unrelated to this also explains that the role of leukocytes is to fend off external breaches by activating immune system, phagocytosis, releasing substances, etc. Thus, leukocytes are able to escape through any vessel walls to arrive at the needed regions of the body ASAP. So they do not have to pass through the capillaries.",Capillary,Don't they also have to travel through the same capillaries?
"The way to identify nucleophiles and electrophiles is by differences in electronegativity. Often, when an electronegative atom is bonded to a less electronegative one, the less electronegative atom becomes an electrophile as it has a partial positive charge. Lone pairs of electrons on some atoms can sometimes act as nucleophiles.",Electrophile,How to identify nucleophiles or electrophiles?
"The rays which came from the positive side are called anode rays (as they were thought to originate from the anode) and were thought to consist of positively charged particles, though it has been proved that the particles are actually those of the ionized gas present in the discharge tube.",Anode,Are the anode rays only nuclei?
"Voltage and current sources generate both voltage and current. The difference between them lies in which parameter (voltage or current) is being controlled. A constant voltage source (like a battery) is designed to generate a controlled voltage. When you put a constant voltage source in a circuit, the voltage across its terminals is always a constant value. Depending on what it is connected to, a voltage source provides (generates) whatever current is needed to keep the voltage on its terminals constant. Example: a 1.5 V battery connected to a 100 ohm resistor will generate a current of 1.5/100 = 15 mA. If you change the resistor to 10 ohms, the voltage will still be 1.5 V but the voltage source will now generate a current of 1.5/10 = 150 mA. Current sources may seem a little strange, but they behave exactly like a voltage source, but with current being controlled. A constant current source is designed to generate a controlled current. When you put a current source in a circuit, the current through the source is always a constant value. Depending on what it is connected to, a current source provides whatever voltage is needed to keep the current on its terminals constant. Example: suppose you have a constant current source set to current = 1 mA. If you connect a 100 ohm resistor across the current source, the voltage will be V = 1 mA x 100 ohms = 0.1 V. If you change the resistor to 1000 ohms, the current will still be 1 mA and the voltage generated by the current source will rise to V = 1 mA x 1000 ohms = 1 V. Most transistors (MOSFET, Bipolar) and the old vacuum tubes have a region of operation where they act just like a current source.",Voltage,Don't a voltage source and a current source both supply a current and voltage in a circuit?
"The inductive effect in ketones actually helps to give the oxygen atom in a carbonyl more electron density than aldehydes. In a ketone, now not only does the oxygen gain electron density from from the carbonyl carbon, it also gains some from the alkyl groups alpha to it. Because of this small addition of electron density, ketones have slightly higher dipole moments as compared to aldehydes with similar molecular weights and thus higher boiling points.",Aldehyde,How do ketones have a stronger dipole moment than aldehydes?
Oxygen as gas can dissolve in water but there is no reaction between oxygen and water. Oxygen and water both retain their molecular form. ,Oxygen,"How does oxygen get dissolved in water,which supports marine life?"
"Certain Plants do grow better around each other and help each other out. Researcher Dr. David Johnson looked closely at plants' symbiotic relationship with soil fungus, piggybacking off a 2010 study that seemed to suggest that a tomato plant infected with leaf blight would be able to warn nearby plants of the problem. In turn, those plants would activate genes that would prevent them from catching the disease, too. Johnson was able to show how plants use fungus in the soil as a network (think of it as a botanical Wi-Fi, if you will). Essentially, fungi deliver messages of danger from plant to plant, and as a result, the group can grow stronger. Even plants get by with a little help from their friends. *Animals* help plants by pollinating them, and be helping to disperse seeds. The droppings of animals also fertilize plants. Plants have three basic responses or reactions to light. They are photosynthesis, phototropism and photoperiodism. As plants react/respond to light the amount of heat wont matter anyway.",Plant,How plants respond to nature?
"First of all, habituations is not the same as imprinting (just be careful not to confuse the terms). Secondly: the interesting thing about imprinting is, that it combines innate parts with learned ones. It is innate for ducks to follow objects that move and make noises. But the ducks can't know how their mother locks exactly and have to learn a picture of her first (13-16 hours after they hatch). So sure, it is inborn for ducks to learn the picture of their mother. But they have to learn it first (it is actually obligatory for them to learn as they have to be able to distinguish between their mother and other adult ducks).",Learning,Why is habituation considered as a learned behavior?
"the tryptophan repressor is itself a protein produced from transcription of another gene, let's call it ""repressor gene"". If that gene mutated, the product of transcription of that gene (the repressor protein) could be nonfunctional. If that were the case the e.coli cell would continually transcribe Tryptophan Enzyme.",Repressor,What happen if the repressor stops functioning?
"Total energy decreases, but energy density tends to increase. The difference is because organisms in lower trophic are typically much more numerous.",Energy density,Why is it that animal-based foods are more energy dense than the plants we eat?
"Hydrogen bonds and London dispersion forces are both examples of van der Waals forces, a general term for intermolecular interactions that do not involve covalent bonds or ions. In a water molecule, the bond connecting the oxygen to each hydrogen is a polar bond. In a polar covalent bond containing hydrogen (e.g., an O-H bond in a water molecule). The hydrogen-oxygen bond in water is not a hydrogen bond, but only a polar covalent bond. However, after hydrogen and oxygen have formed a water molecule and hydrogen has become partially positive, then the hydrogen atoms become attracted to nearby negative charges and are 'available' for hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bond between these hydrogen atoms and the nearby negatively charged atoms is weak and doesn't involve the covalent bond between hydrogen and oxygen. Thus, hydrogen bonding is a van der Waals force. ",Covalent bond,"How does the hydrogen bond in it conform to their definition of van dear Waals forces, which don't involve covalent bonds?"
"If you have the same number of electrons as protons, just like you would in any atom because all atoms have the same number of electrons as protons, then the charge is neutral",Proton,Will electrons always start with same number of protons?
"We do not need plasmid. Plasmids are naturally occurring in Bacteria and rarely in Eukaryotic cells. For Bacteria, which have nucleoid, the plasmid is pretty useful carrying additional genes such as antibiotic resistance or lethal mutation. It also helps horizontal gene transfer. And not to mention Scientific studies where we can artificially introduce wanted molecule via plasmid into target cell.",Plasmid,And why do we need Plasmid?
For example water has polar bonds and oil is made of nonpolar bonds. Like dissolves like and opposites oppose so they do not dissolve in eachother. This can be useful since solvents can be used to dissolve certain compounds and not others making it possible to extract them or just put in a solvent and have it boil off leaving a dry material behind (eg paint).,Chemical polarity,How does caring if it`s a polar or non-polar covalent bond help us?
"Vector plasmids are generally small enough that it's uptake is negligible to the overall size of DNA in the host. In cases where the host nucleus is smaller, bacteriaphage viruses with individual strands are used as vectors, and only inject small amounts of genetic material. ",Plasmid,Is the bacterias native plasmid kicked out or do they become neighbors?
"For these it's probably best to go back to first principles and work it out. Draw the structure, then break every bond. Assign both electrons in each bond to the more electronegative atom of that bond. If the atoms are the same (eg a C-C bond) then assign 1 electron to each. Then subtract how many electrons have been given to each atom from the valence electrons their neutral atom would have, that's the oxidation state.",Electron,Would we divide the electrons equally between same atoms?
"Think of voltage as elevation on a mountain. Suppose people take a hike starting at some elevation (typically the bottom of the mountain where elevation = 0). As people hike up, their elevation (voltage) increases. When people reach a high point and walk down, their elevation (voltage) decreases. People walk all day, up and down and all around the mountainside. At the end of their hike them return to their starting point. If people come back to their starting point, all the ups and downs their total change of elevation is 0. That is the essence of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law.",Voltage,Why do the voltages have to add to zero when we end up back at the same voltage?
"Ionic loses an electron it has a positive charge, and after another element gains an electron it has a negative charge. Opposite charges attract one another.",Chemical element,What force brings these two elements together?
"Since ultrabithorax is inactivated, no halteres are present. Fly apart from being unable to fly also cannot balance off. That mutation is lethal.",Halteres,Does the fly still develop halteres that help it to balance?
"The ability to transform base metals into Gold was one of the main goals of Alchemists in in Middle Ages and Renaissance Europe, and it was called Chrysopoeia. However, the final goal of the Alchemist was not the making of money. It's even been done in nuclear reactors. Sadly, there are two problems: 1) You normally get a radioactive form of gold (a radio-isotope), so it doesn't stay gold for very long. 2) The cost to make the gold (cost for the electricity you need to power a particle accelerator or whatever) is bigger than the price of gold. Transmutation of atoms or changing of one atom to another is possible but involves high costs. You will have to shell out a lot of bucks to transmutate 1 gram of lead to 1 gram of gold but the money you earn from selling the gold, will be insignificant compared the cost of converting lead to gold. We can change atoms into gold or any other element,however the expense of adding or removing nucleons ( protons & neutrons ) would in itself be so much ,so I don't think you could get rich by doing it, plus ,the technology is way too expensive.But maybe it'll be easier in the future. Technically speaking, it could be possible through atomic fusion, but stars, the original source of fusion, only has enough energy to create iron through this process. While a solar fusion engine has been created, it would need several times the power it can give to fuse elements heavier than iron. Also, the energy to run said engine would cost so much that it would be cheaper to try to extract minerals from asteroids in space.",Atom,Could people get rich changing a lead atom into a gold or silver atom and then selling it for money?
"It depends on the polyatomic ion's covalent bonds. Usually, a central atom will have the other elements around it, and a negative is shown because somewhere, in one of the bonds, an electron is missing. This causes an Ion, but because we cannot pinpoint lon exact place it is said that the full polyatomic molecule is a total charge.",Polyatomic ion,What is the reason for the formation of polyatomic ions?
"humans cannot mate with any other species of ape. Their DNA is just too different. there would just be an offspring with some human features and some features of whatever ape was bred with. The present-day apes also evolved from the apes of long ago, just like humans. humans didn't evolve from say a chimpanzee, humans and chimpanzees just evolved from another species of ape that is extinct now. Since that species does not exist anymore, you can breed something that demonstrated a half-way point in evolution.",Ape,"Human evolve from apes, so if one mated with a human?"
"once the sodium gave up its electron to hydrogen, it has a full shell like a noble gas, meaning it doesn't want to react. The only thing left for that H to react with is another H, forming H2. Sodium is not electronegative. It is electropositive being in group one of the periodic table. ",Hydrogen,Why does the Hydrogen choose to bond with another hydrogen in the final step instead of to sodium?
Electronegativity is increases from the left side of the periodic table to the right side and from the bottom up with Fluorine being the most electronegative atom possible.,Electronegativity,How to compare the electronegativity?
"absolute zero is the temperature which is defined as the temperature needed so that all kinetic energy of particles stops. Since diffusion requires particles to move, molecules at 0 K cannot diffuse. Of course, if gravity is pulling them downward, then the molecules can diffuse.",Diffusion,Would diffusion take place at all?
"Certain Plants do grow better around each other and help each other out. Researcher Dr. David Johnson looked closely at plants' symbiotic relationship with soil fungus, piggybacking off a 2010 study that seemed to suggest that a tomato plant infected with leaf blight would be able to warn nearby plants of the problem. In turn, those plants would activate genes that would prevent them from catching the disease, too. Johnson was able to show how plants use fungus in the soil as a network (think of it as a botanical Wi-Fi, if you will). Essentially, fungi deliver messages of danger from plant to plant, and as a result, the group can grow stronger. Even plants get by with a little help from their friends. *Animals* help plants by pollinating them, and be helping to disperse seeds. The droppings of animals also fertilize plants. Plants have three basic responses or reactions to light. They are photosynthesis, phototropism and photoperiodism. As plants react/respond to light the amount of heat wont matter anyway.",Plant,Do plants respond to night light with no heat?
Being able to get useful work from a system of energy requires you to go from a low entropy or more ordered form of energy to a higher entropy of less ordered form of energy. If you want to use heat as an energy source you need to have a lower temperature area for the heat energy to go to. If you have a steam engine you have to use fuel to add heat to the water to get it to a temperature where is converts to steam. This steam expands into the cooler environment. In this case you are taking the low entropy energy in the chemical bonds of the fuel and creating high entropy heat energy that transferred to the water increasing its entropy when it gets hotter and eventually converts into steam creating the pressure to do work like creating electricity. If the entire environment was as the same temperature of the burning fuel the water would already be steam and it couldn't be made to do anything.,Energy,Can't we just reuse the already existing energy? Why can't you turn heat into energy?
Generally a weak acid will produce a basic salt and a weak base will produce an acidic salt. Generally strong acids and bases will produce neutral salts. Acidic salts react with water to form H3O+ Basic salts react with water to form OH- Neutral salts do not react with water to produce H3O+ or OH,Acid,How do you tell acidic salt and a normal salt apart?
"There are reaction conditions and reaction apparatuses which can remove water during the reaction. For example, I can set up a concomitant reaction in the same apparatus where the reactant is water, the reaction equilibrium strongly favors the products and the products are not reactive with acetyl chloride. ",Acetyl chloride,How is acetyl chloride formed?
"Oxygen is not one of the atoms that violates the octet rule. In a stable compound, it will have 8 valence electrons. In this compound, it has 2 bonding pairs (4 electrons). There must be 4 unshown electrons, so they will be present as 2 lone pairs.",Octet rule,How to know it is not there without fulfilling the octet rule?
"Bohr model has been replaced by the modern model of the atom. The Bohr model only worked for Hydrogen atoms, and even for hydrogen it left a lot unexplained. The reason it works somewhat for hydrogen is that even though the electrons are not in orbits there are certain energy concepts for orbits that have more universal applicability",Bohr model,Why does Bohr model work?
"pH 7 was chosen as neutral because it's in the center of the pH scale- there are 7 levels above and below it. The meaning of pH is disputed, but the most widely used one is '*p*ower of *H*ydrogen' because pH measures the power, or concentration, of H+ ions in the substance.",PH,Why pH 7 is chosen as neutral?
"First of all, birds do not sleep as long as we humans and therefore do not spend too much time in the same position. Second, birds are fairly smaller animals, therefore, their oxygen daily intake is much smaller than compared to us humans.",Bird,How do the birds survive while trees release carbon dioxide during the night?
"The electron can only have specific states, nothing in between. By releasing a photon of a particular amount of energy, an electron can drop into one of the lower energy levels. If it happens to drop to an intermediate level, not n=1, the it is still in an excited state (albeit a lower excited state than it previously had). It will, if conditions allow, eventually drop back to n=1. So, it is not a matter of the electron not returning to n=1, it is just that it might do so in a number of steps instead of all at once. An electron in the n=1 state is stable because it cannot go any lower, being already at the lowest allowed energy state state, and can only go higher if energy is applied. So, it cannot cannot spontaneously move. That is the sense in which it is stable. In general, an electron at any energy level cannot spontaneously jump up since that would require an outside source of energy. But it can at any time spontaneously jump down to any lower energy level by ejecting a photon. Any level below it is just as likely as any other for it to jump to. But it is a one-way ratchet. It can only go down, and it soons finds itself back at the bottom.",Electron,"Why would an electron fall back to any energy level other than the n=1, since there are no other electrons stopping it from falling there?"
"The atom bomb derives its' energy from a process of fission or fusion. The first atomic bomb was a fissionable device in which a larger less stable atom is split. The initial mass of the atom is greater than the parts further divided and thus is converted to energy by E=mc^2. So even a tiny mass or few relative atoms can create huge amount of energy released. The atom bomb really deals with the nucleus and not the whole atom. Hydrogen bombs are when a fission bomb is used to initiate a fusion bomb of smaller nuclei such as hydrogen. The order of magnitude for a thermonuclear bond (H-bomb) is on the order of 10,000,000 tons of TNT,while the atom bomb is more about 20,000 tons of TNT as per the first testing of each of these types of bombs. when spliting an atom, a HUGE amount of energy comes out and this is what makes the atom bomb so powerful and fearful!! the trigger sets a fission course on the earth and energy then becomes destructive. It splits the atom, thus exploding, kind of like how we use nuclear fission to harness the energy creating nuclear power. The atom bomb comes into play because elements such as plutonium and uranium are used in bombs as they in particular have high levels of energy output in fission.",Nuclear weapon,How does the atom bomb fall into that every element is made up of unique atoms?
"The oxygen have 8 valence electrons in the water molecule. Oxygen started out with 6 valence electrons. By combining with two atoms of hydrogen it shares with each hydrogen one electron of its own and one electron from the hydrogen, so it shares a total of two of its electron with a total of two electrons from the hydrogen. This is a total of 4 electrons being shared. But, it still has the other 4 valence electrons that it kept for itself which did not react with anything. Instead, they paired up within the oxygen atom into what are called ""lone pairs"". It has two lone pairs, for a total of 4 valence electron in lone pairs. So, the extra 4 valence electrons are in lone pairs. But the total of all valence electrons is 8. There are 4 electrons involved in bonds and 4 valence electron in two lone pairs.",Oxygen,Why oxygen atoms in the molecular formula of water has 4 more atoms that can be used for other bonds?
"While a strong acid always has a weak conjugate base, moderately weak acids have, moderately weak conjugate bases .A strong acid (or base) more-or-less completely dissociates in water.Its conjugate base (or acid) more-or-less completely fails to go in the reverse direction. In practice the conjugate base (or acid) is not really acting as a base (or acid) at all! In contrast, moderately weak acids and bases undergo partial dissociation in water and by necessity their conjugate base or acid *must* also undergo partial dissociation.",Conjugate (acid-base theory),"Weaker the acid, stronger the conjugate base?"
Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon and hydrogen. It does attract the bonding electrons significantly more than those two.,Electronegativity,Why cant oxygen atom do this inspite o is more electronegative than c and h?
"With the exception of the hydrogen and helium that were formed shortly after the Big Bang event, elements mainly form in the following ways: 1. Fusion in the core of a star. 2. Fusion during a supernovae. 3. Decay of a radioactive isotope. 4. Being changed from one type of atom to another by high energy nuclear reactions, such as having a neutron slam into the nucleus at an extremely high velocity. There are a few other ways, but they are not all that significant. Each isotope (more properly called a nuclide) has its own way(s) in which it is formed. There is not one set way they form. So, it is not possible to give you a general answer other than to say that the isotopes of an element form in one or more of the above ways, but each isotope of an element may or may not form in a similar way as other isotopes. Except as listed above, an atom that is not radioactive never changes its number of neutrons. So you do not usually have one isotope changing into another isotope of the same element. There are ways it can happen, but they are not the normal course of events. ",Isotope,Do  isotopes ever lose the extra neutron(s) or gain new ones?
"Hydrogen does not follow the octet rule, so that is part of why H2 is stable. Note: H2 is stable, but it is quite reactive. The octet rule follows from the energetic favorability of having both the s and p subshells either completely empty or completely full. There is no p subshell in shell number 1, so that is part of why the lightest elements do not follow the octet rule (there are other reasons). There are many considerations as to what does or does not make an atom with a particular electron configuration reactive or nonreactive. So, while the octet rule is a convenient rule of thumb, the reality of chemistry is much, much more complicated. So, with chemistry, there are many competing factors that affect how elements behave, so you cannot just take a single rule and insist or suspect that every element must necessarily follow that rule. It doesn't work that way. You have to take all of the factors into consideration to predict how an element might behave. NOTE: The Pauli exclusion principle is one of the few laws that all of the elements always obey. But the octet rule is not always followed.",Chemical element,Why are the elements in group 2 not stable with 2 valence electrons?
"A typical plasmid can accommodate inserts of any size up to total size of around 50 kb, but plasmids that are more than 20 kb are very difficult to work with and may require special transformation techniques.",Plasmid,Does size have any impact on the size of the plasmid that needs to be used?
"Resonance decreases reactivity because it increases the stability of the molecule. The reason why resonance is decreasing the reactivity of the carboxylic acid is because moving the electrons causes the carbonyl carbon to become less partially positive (which makes the carboxylic acid more stable). When you stabilize the carboxylic acid by making the carbonyl carbon less positive, you are decreasing its ability to be an electrophile in a reaction (in other words, you are making the molecule less reactive due to the increase in stability from the resonance). Reactivity and stability are two opposing concepts. The more stable a molecule is, the less it wants to react. A decrease in stability results in an increase in reactivity and an increase in stability causes a decrease in reactivity. Think of it this way: a molecule always wants to be in it's most stable form. If it's not stable, it is going to want to react in order to stabilize itself. If it's already stable, it doesn't need to react.",Reactivity (chemistry),How is resonance decreasing reactivity?
"the oxygen atom is only being bound to a hydrogen ion (proton), not a hydrogen atom (so the electron, the negative charge, is not included). Since a typical hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron, a hydrogen ion is just the same as one proton. Therefore, the oxygen has picked up an extra proton,which means it has a positive charge.",Hydrogen,Why the oxygen acquires a positive charge when it bounds to a hydrogen?
"Bulk transport is basically describing how larger molecules/ particles are transported across membranes. ie. Particles that are too large to go through pores, channels or even be translocated by proteins. Endocytosis and exocytosis are types of bulk transport.
