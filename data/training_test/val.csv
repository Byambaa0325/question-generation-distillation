"The Calvin cycle is dependent on the Light-dependent reactions, and almost in the same way Light-dependent reactions are dependent on 'The Calvin Cycle'. The 'light-dependent reactions' receive light, and provide energy for the Calvin cycle. After used by the Calvin cycle, the molecules go back to the thylakoids to be reenergized in a way. So it is almost like a constant cycle between the two areas.",Calvin cycle,Does the Calvin cycle happen after the light-dependent reactions occurs or is the Calvin cycle independent?
Introns have multiple roles in biology including the regulation of gene expression. Other introns have functions after they are spliced out from the transcript and can act as signaling or regulatory molecules. Some relatively rare types of introns appear to be parasitic DNA molecules - they insert copies of themselves into genes and then splice themselves out from the RNA presumably to keep the host cell alive. It is possible that the more typical introns originated from such parasitic DNA elements. This is still an area of active research and it is quite likely that more functions for introns will be uncovered in the future.,Intron,Why are introns are formed?
"the first stage would be the 'activation of amino acids'. Basically this step is before the initiation stage. During this activation of amino acids a specific amino acid and an ATP will bind to an enzyme called ""aminoacyl-tRNA synthesas"". The specific amino acid will bind the aminoacyl-tRNA synthesas where it will be activated by covalently binding with the ATP turning it into AMP during the process (releasing pyrophosphate). Then a tRNA will bind the aminoacyl-tRNA synthesas and it will covalently bind with the activated amino acid (releasing AMP). When the amino acid and the tRNA bind they will be released from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthesas and can then bind with the corresponding mRNA codon. So, when the tRNA leaves the E site is basically starts over the above process.",Transfer RNA,From where does tRNA get revived to continue its function in the future?
"the Ruminococcus is in the cow's food, or is somehow enhaled by the cow. Like a virus or any type of bacteria that infect humans, this bacteria probably could get into the cow's gut easily through some passageway of the mouth or nose, and maybe later on in the cow's life, meaning not right after the cow's birth, since in the beginning the new baby calf will probably drink milk. I think that's how it works.",Ruminococcus,How does Ruminococcus get in the cow's gut to begin with?
"A tRNA contains hairpins though the hairpins play different roles in the two cases. In transcription termination, the hairpin causes the RNA polymerase to stall and the transcript to separate from the DNA. In a tRNA, multiple hairpins form and give the tRNA molecule the 3D shape it needs to perform its job of delivering amino acids.",Transfer RNA,Is tRNA formed from these hairpin structures?
"Equilibrium must occur in a closed system (with a reversible reaction), you cannot have equilibrium in an open system, as small particles, especially gasses, can easily escape. In an open system, vaporisation does occur if the heat is at the concerned element's boiling point, as it turns into a gas and escapes, so vaporisation is one of the reasons why the equilibrium must occur in a closed system",Open system (systems theory),Does vaporization occur in an open system?
"It is just the fact that Earth temperature (the timestamp when life began and persists) is not as high as 100 ^C. Speaking of atmospheric temperature. Also, the atmospheric pressure comes into a place, the temperature itself is not the only variable.",Temperature,Would that salt water need to be heated at a higher temperature before it began to evaporate?
"This is an essential cycle that never stops until you die: ADP gets phosphorylated in the mitochondria, storing energy in ATP, and the ATP gets used to perform cellular work, releasing its energy in coupled reactions, and transforming back to ADP.",Adenosine diphosphate,Can ADP be used again to form back ATP?
The bonds of the elements in fire have frequencies and the electrons in the atoms are changing orbital levels from high energy to lower energy levels while the matter is being oxidized thus creatinine a electro magnetic fields some of which (frequencies) are falling into the visual frequency range. The frequency range could be determined ed only if you knew what elements and how they are bonded.,Frequency,How to calculate the frequency of the fire?
"Carbon 12 is stable and is very common, so any lab can get it easily. You would want an element that has an equal number of neutrons and protons. C12 is one of many that fit that requirement. Before they used carbon, they used to use oxygen, until the 1960's",Carbon-12,Is there any specific reason mole was defined using the number of elemental entities of carbon-12?
"there is one enzyme which is crucial for translation and that is ""aminoacyl tRNA synthetase"". This enzyme attaches an amino acid to the tRNA. There is a different version of this for every different amino acid (so 20 of these in human bodies). The enzyme is a ""synthetase"" because it creates a new structure called ""aminoacyl-tRNA"", which is the tRNA which has an amino acid linked to it. The word ""aminoacyl"" means that an amino acid is linked to something, in this case tRNA. This process happens BEFORE the tRNA enters the ribosome and it takes place in the cytosol. ATP is required for that reaction.",Enzyme,Is the ribosome an enzyme or does it just ACT as an enzyme?
"To prevent this the temperature at which the primers bind is chosen to not be too close so that more primers bind than DNA back together. Oftentimes, when you cool it down, it's not as cool as it originally was when all of the DNA was joined back together.",DNA,What measures should be taken to ensure that the possibility of DNA template interconnection rather than primers does not occur?
"The states of matter depend on two things, pressure, and temperature. If the temperate increases than the general energy increases and the molecules break away from each other thus causing the element to change to a higher state of matter, such as from liquid to gas. But the same is true with pressure except in a different way. If the pressure exerted on water is increased the molecules are squished together and it changes to a solid, but if the pressure is decreased the molecules are ""pulled apart"" and the state changes to a gas without the temperature having to change at all.",Temperature,How is water supposed to evaporate at 25 degrees Celsius?
"There are two double bonds between C and O, and two lone pairs of electrons on each Oxygen. During the formation of CO, what happens is the absence of the second oxygen is solved by the donation of one of those lone pairs of electrons from the oxygen to the carbon. So two of the bonds are simple covalent bonds, in which each atom supplies one electron to the bond, and the third bond is a co-ordinate covalent bond (i.e. both electrons provided only by O). Count the electrons and notice that both have 8 in their outer shell. That's is all molecules want",Oxygen,How does oxygen get a triple bond with carbon?
"As a cell grows in size, the surface area gets bigger, but the volume gets bigger faster. Thinking about this as a ratio (division), the volume is the denominator and the surface area is the numerator. If the volume is getting very big, then the ratio itself will be getting very small. What this translates to is as a cell gets larger, with a larger volume, it has a smaller SA:V. A smaller SA:V means that diffusion of nutrients and diffusion of waste in less efficient (harder to do). The rate of diffusion doesn't change, but it would take longer for the nutrients to diffuse through to the centre of the cell than a cell with a higher SA:V (a smaller cell - i.e. a cell with a smaller volume)",Surface area,What does surface area have to do with how much energy it takes for these transfers to occur?
"Oxygen is not one of the atoms that violates the octet rule. In a stable compound, it will have 8 valence electrons. In this compound, it has 2 bonding pairs (4 electrons). There must be 4 unshown electrons, so they will be present as 2 lone pairs.",Octet rule,How to know it is not there without fulfilling the octet rule?
"tetrahedral e.g. carbon at the centre of the tetrahedron, hydrogens at the four vertices. Trigonal pyramidal e.g. nitrogen at a vertex of the triangular pyramid (apex of pyramid), hydrogens at the vertices of the triangular base of pyramid. A tetrahedron is a regular triangular pyramid. But the way the word ""tetrahedral"" is used is different from what you normally think of when you picture a tetrahedron. They say that CH4 (methane) has a tetrahedral shape. Now, you may think the four C-H bonds form a tetrahedron, but that's wrong: they don't. If you join the four hydrogen atoms with straight lines, you'd get a tetrahedron in that case. Trigonal pyramidal, on the other hand, is different. They might say NH3 is trigonal pyramidal, by which they mean that the 3 N-H bonds form three sides of a triangular pyramid, where the N is the apex of the pyramid. The triangular ""base"" of the pyramid is formed by the three H atoms joined to each other. I don't want to confuse you, but trigonal pyramidal shaped NH3 has a tetrahedral ""geometry"".",Tetrahedron,How is trigonal pyramidal different from tetrahedral?
"A v-shape ('bent') shape occurs when an atom has 3 attached groups, with one of those groups being a lone pair. It also occurs when an atom has 4 attached groups and 2 of those groups are lone pairs. Be careful though, these shapes are called the same name, but they have different bond angles. A general chem class might require that you know 1 lone pair = less than 120 degrees, 2 lone pairs = less than 109.5 degrees. Also, It is possible for an atom to have 5 or even 6 groups attached to it (these cases are called expanded octets), such as Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).",Lone pair,Species have lone pairs molecular geometry can only be v-shaped or trigonal pyramid?
We cant treat light the same way we treat matter because daily things travel very slowly but when you are travelling at speeds beyond 10^6 ms^-1 the science is different matter and energy are interconvertible (e=mc^2) so it doesn't really store energy it is energy itself.,Energy,How does the photon carry energy?
"Symporters and antiporters use the energy stored in the electrochemical gradient. Depending on which membrane is being discussed, the electrochemical gradient may created by either metabolic processes (e.g. the electron transport chain in mitochondria) and/or by using ATP to pump ions ""uphill"" (against their electrochemical gradient). Secondary active transport means that, rather than directly using ATP to power the movement of compounds across the membrane, proteins like symporters and antiporters use the energy stored in the electrochemical gradient. The electrochemical gradient is the combined ""push"" due to concentration and charge differences across the membrane.",Antiporter,Do the symporters and antiporters use ATP?
"Secondary succession is when species recolonize the habitat. I do not think that during winter species are _wiped off_ the forest. they do change their behavior action and plant are hidden under the snow, but it does not mean they disappear. If you consider swallow migration to South and then returning to North in the spring, only in that case your definition can apply. Those are migrations and cyclic changes that happen every year regularly (under just one year span) so I am not sure whether we can call it secondary succession.",Secondary succession,Does secondary succession always have to occur?
"We do not need plasmid. Plasmids are naturally occurring in Bacteria and rarely in Eukaryotic cells. For Bacteria, which have nucleoid, the plasmid is pretty useful carrying additional genes such as antibiotic resistance or lethal mutation. It also helps horizontal gene transfer. And not to mention Scientific studies where we can artificially introduce wanted molecule via plasmid into target cell.",Plasmid,And why do we need Plasmid?
"A ligament can be injured, usually by being over-stretched during a sudden pull. The ligaments at the side of the ankle are the ones most commonly sprained. A damaged ankle ligament causes inflammation, swelling, and bleeding (which shows as bruising) around the affected joint. Moving of the joint is painful.",Ligament,How is a ligament tear different from a sprain and why does it require surgery?
"Certain Plants do grow better around each other and help each other out. Researcher Dr. David Johnson looked closely at plants' symbiotic relationship with soil fungus, piggybacking off a 2010 study that seemed to suggest that a tomato plant infected with leaf blight would be able to warn nearby plants of the problem. In turn, those plants would activate genes that would prevent them from catching the disease, too. Johnson was able to show how plants use fungus in the soil as a network (think of it as a botanical Wi-Fi, if you will). Essentially, fungi deliver messages of danger from plant to plant, and as a result, the group can grow stronger. Even plants get by with a little help from their friends. *Animals* help plants by pollinating them, and be helping to disperse seeds. The droppings of animals also fertilize plants. Plants have three basic responses or reactions to light. They are photosynthesis, phototropism and photoperiodism. As plants react/respond to light the amount of heat wont matter anyway.",Plant,Do plants respond to night light with no heat?
"The efficiency of the respiratory system is very very efficient. Imagine a system of pipes; one pulls the air, another transfers it. Since pipes are rounded and therefore 'closed' air cannot escape through the piping. Take for example your hand. Curl it, and blow through it. Almost none or if any air escapes, except through the other side. Because of this, the only path for the air to take is to the lungs. In which the lungs work/use the air and the entire cycle happens again. When a biological system is working many other dependent systems are working too.",Atmosphere of Earth,Does some air leak or escape?
"We know because of the magnetic field. Theoretically, we can't prove the existence of the core of the earth but there is no other way that the magnetic field of the earth and other planets are possible. It even explains the lack of magnetic field for things like the moon or Mars. Everything in science is a theory. We have seismic data that suggests there is something very dense at the center of the earth. We know that the core gives off heat. It makes sense that the heaviest elements would go to the center of the planet as the planet formed.",Earth,Is that Earth (or any other planet in solar system) has a core a theory?
Quantum Physics can be used synonimically to Quantum Mechanics and even Quantum Theory. Quantum Physics is theory which try to explain why Classical Mechanics doesn't work in cases,Quantum mechanics,What is its difference to Quantum Mechanics?
"When you sprain your ankle your ligaments (bone to bone connections) get stretched and may get partially torn. This causes the body to respond with inflammation and this response is the normal and a necessary response to tissue damage. Next question may be ""What is and how does inflammatory response work?. In short the damaged and dead cells need repair. This causes your blood vessels to dilate accounting for the redness you see around the insulted tissue. The swelling is also the result of capillary dilation. As capillaries dilate the gaps between get larger allowing fluid to leak out in the surrounding area.",Ligament,How is a ligament tear different from a sprain and why does it require surgery?
