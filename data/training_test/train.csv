"It depends on the polyatomic ion's covalent bonds. Usually, a central atom will have the other elements around it, and a negative is shown because somewhere, in one of the bonds, an electron is missing. This causes an Ion, but because we cannot pinpoint lon exact place it is said that the full polyatomic molecule is a total charge.",Polyatomic ion,What is the reason for the formation of polyatomic ions?
"Oxidation numbers can vary quite a lot for some atoms, but are very consistent for others. Oxygen is actually among the most reliable atoms, as far as oxidation number. It nearly always counts for 2-, except when it's part of a peroxide, when it is instead 1-. Fluorine has a 1-, with no exceptions. Other halogens also tend to have 1-, unless there is oxygen involved, as in polyatomic ions like chlorate and chlorite. This makes sense if you think about electronegativity. Halogens are pretty electronegative, and tend to pull an electron toward them. But if you compare the actual EN values, oxygen is actually more electronegative than anything but fluorine, and tends to pull electrons away from even chlorine and the rest. Fluorine is always 1-, because it pulls hardest, and only wants one electron, while oxygen pulls almost as hard, and wants two electrons, so it is almost always 2-. It's also important to remember that in a pure element, the oxidation number is 0, *by definition*. So, in O2, both oxygen atoms have oxidation number 0, just as both fluorines in F2 have 0, and so on.",Oxidation state,How to work out what its oxidation number is?
"The control of purple color in flowers, axils, and seed covers is all from the same gene phenotype is the flower color",Gene,Is the gene coding for the axil color what affects the flower color?
"the brain and the spinal chord are the two components of the central nervous system which interpret messages and control the actions of/from the rest of the peripheral nervous system. It's called the central nervous system not because of its position in the human body, but its role in the overall function of our nervous system.",Central nervous system,Why is the brain included in central nervous system?
Generally a weak acid will produce a basic salt and a weak base will produce an acidic salt. Generally strong acids and bases will produce neutral salts. Acidic salts react with water to form H3O+ Basic salts react with water to form OH- Neutral salts do not react with water to produce H3O+ or OH,Acid,How do you tell acidic salt and a normal salt apart?
There's no hard and fast rule that the definition of ecosystem has to necessarily contain the word 'abiotic factors'; only the word 'environment' is enough. For example: There are bacteria in the gut which help in breaking down food. And there are no abiotic 'factors' present in the gut. Here the gut is the bacteria's environment. So it's absolutely ok if we have an ecosystem without an abiotic factor.,Ecosystem,Could a ecosystem just have biotic factors but not abiotic factors?
"metabolism is more like the whole system which is made of skeleton - anabolic and catabolic reactions. There are many ""circuits"", dots are connected (intermediates connected by enzymes which make anabolism and catabolism happen). It is so dynamic, as cell itself is dynamic",Metabolism,Does metabolism happen all time?
"the tryptophan repressor is itself a protein produced from transcription of another gene, let's call it ""repressor gene"". If that gene mutated, the product of transcription of that gene (the repressor protein) could be nonfunctional. If that were the case the e.coli cell would continually transcribe Tryptophan Enzyme.",Repressor,What happen if the repressor stops functioning?
"Particles in air will be able to travel at speeds greater than the speed of sound (300m/s) but I don't think this will cause a sonic boom because think about what sound is: sound is caused by the movement (compression and rarefractions) of molecules in the air. Sonic booms do not exist in space because there is no air and sound can therefore not travel. For the tiniest molecule in air, there is practically no such thing as air for sonic boom: the air molecule is floating in a vacuum with other air molecules but it does not have anything to ""cause"" a boom through any medium.",Sonic boom,Would air particles perform a tiny sonic boom?
"A cell stays small to allow easier transport of molecules and charged particles from organelles. If the intermembrane space of the mitochondria was increased, respiration would be less efficient, because now the electrons have to cross a larger space and lose much more energy.",Mitochondrion,What effect would increasing the colume of the intermembrane space have on the function of a mitochondrion?
"The molecules in the water have a range of kinetic energies, from low to high. Some of the molecules have sufficient kinetic energy to break out and to enter the air. In coastal areas there are also factors. For example, waves churn up the water and give rise to very fine droplets that can get carried in the wind.",Water,How does water evaporate?
"xylem keeps getting water (it is thanks to the forces not based on the real plant needs). If the plant has nowhere to let go of water in the flower pot (no hole to let go of excessive water) it keeps 'drowning'. If transpiration cannot help all the water got through the body to the leaves, then water will just stay in the plant tissues.",Plant,Why do plants die from over-watering?
"For autosomal recessive where there is no skipped generation, the other parent must be heterozygous for the trait, which would mean the children have a chance of having the recessive trait through inheriting the recessive chromosome from the carrier parent. For X-linked recessive, the same is true, with one parent being a carrier. Ways to prove X-linked recessive are that if the trait is recessive, there will be mother-son and/or daughter-father links. This means that if the mother is affected, the son must be as he must inherit one of her affected X chromosomes. The same is true with daughter-father links. If the daughter is affected then the father must also be as she will inherit one of her X chromosomes from him.",Dominance (genetics),How to figure out that the trait is recessive?
"Anabolic reactions are defined as biological reactions that create more complex (larger) molecules. Anabolic reactions are endergonic (store energy). Anabolic reactions do use energy harvested from catabolic processes, but that is not typically part of the definition of anabolism.",Anabolism,Does anabolism and catabolism is a cyclic process?
"oxygen, nitrogen and fluorine only bind in the same way in that they form covalent bonds. Otherwise, they are completely different. To name a few: each of them form different number of bonds. Cl bonded with hydrogen is an acid, while N bonded with hydrogen is basic. Also, note that nitrogen is only more abundant in the air we breathe. Oxygen is by far the most common element on earth (47% of earth mass)",Nitrogen,Why is there so much more water on Earth than ammonia even though nitrogen is more abundant?
"When we are buried in the ground... the bacteria and other de-composers break down our body into simpler chemical forms. which are then taken up by plants and then the cycle continues. Energy is also returned as the organism secretes or excretes during it's life. Exchanges are during all the organism life: Pooh, pee, sweat and respirations (secretions & excretions = give back to the ecosystem), and to eat (to lend energy and materials to the ecosystem). And death is only the final give back.",Energy,How is energy of human returned to other animals?
"The number of electrons leaving the metal sample will be very small in comparison with the total number of electrons in the metal. Nonetheless, I would expect that the metal would want to lose the slight positive charge it had acquired by stealing electrons from elsewhere. An analogy might be static electricity that you can build up on an inflated balloon by rubbing it - it's not a permanent charge and after a few minutes the charge is lost.",Metal,What happens to the metal after it cools down?
"The oxygen have 8 valence electrons in the water molecule. Oxygen started out with 6 valence electrons. By combining with two atoms of hydrogen it shares with each hydrogen one electron of its own and one electron from the hydrogen, so it shares a total of two of its electron with a total of two electrons from the hydrogen. This is a total of 4 electrons being shared. But, it still has the other 4 valence electrons that it kept for itself which did not react with anything. Instead, they paired up within the oxygen atom into what are called ""lone pairs"". It has two lone pairs, for a total of 4 valence electron in lone pairs. So, the extra 4 valence electrons are in lone pairs. But the total of all valence electrons is 8. There are 4 electrons involved in bonds and 4 valence electron in two lone pairs.",Oxygen,Why oxygen atoms in the molecular formula of water has 4 more atoms that can be used for other bonds?
"CNS is the brain and spinal cord. PNS includes the cranial nerves and spinal nerves. We like to categorize and define things, but they are connected. Afferent means sensory information going to the brain, Efferent means motor information from the CNS. Efferent, or motor commands includes somatic n.s., or skeletal muscle system , sympathetic n.s. and parasympathetic n.s.",Cranial nerves,Are the cranial nerves part of the CNS and the spinal nerves part of the PNS?
"boiling point will change, that has a lot to do with atmospheric pressure, and that is why in some places it takes a higher heat to boil or in others a lower heat to boil. Also about that topic it can take a longer time to boil or shorter based on atmospheric pressure, but that has more to do with pressure than heat.",Boiling point,How will the boiling point change?
"If the 2s orbital bonds with a hydrogen the bond will be shorter than the bonds formed by 3 2p orbitals with hydrogen. If this was the case, ammonia would have 3 long bonds and a short bond. However, when the shape of ammonia was discovered, it was clear that all N-H bond lengths were equal, hence the idea of 2s and 2p orbitals forming individual bonds with the hydrogen was discarded and hybridization was able to explain the shape of ammonia.",Ammonia,Why Nitrogen needs sp3 Hybridization to form ammonia?
carbon will almost always follow the octet rule. CO isn't an exception to this. The third bond here comes from a lone pair on O being shared with C. the hybridisation is sp for both O and C. Experimentally we find the bond length in CO is shorter than a C-O double bond and similar to the N-N triple bond length in N2. So a triple bond in CO here does sense.,Triple bond,How does oxygen get a triple bond with carbon?
"every species has a different number of chromosomes for its specific needs. Like a hedgehog has 108 chromosomes while we only have 46 (or 23 pairs). They all pair for specific needs. That's why animals that are closely related have close to the same number of genes. Like most prime apes have 48 chromosomes, which is only 1 more pair than us.( Humans are technically prime apes)",Chromosome,A chromosome has just DNA with different number of pairs?
"Rest of organelles are around the nucleus and the mitotic spindle. Kinetochore makes sure chromosomes attach to the mitotic spindle. regardless of the nucleus, centrosome and centriole make sure that mitosis proceeds as expected.",Chromosome,What makes chromosomes stay there?
Gay and bisexual orientations are behavioural variations resulting from the expression of a regular gene set. If your question is really about hermaphroditism then such individuals possess cells with 46 xy and 46 xx sets of chromosomes and exhibit sexual characteristics of both males and females.,Chromosome,How many chromosomes would a person have?
"not all supernova remnants are hydrogen poor. The Crab nebula, for instance, has significant hydrogen left over. Not all hydrogen is necessarily consumed by a star before its life ends. Only the hydrogen in the core of the sun is consumed. There is still a significant amount of hydrogen outside the core that is never burned, and when/if that star goes supernova, it's available to coalesce into a new star. type 2 supernovae (the more common type) have lots of hydrogen. Only a small percentage of the star supports fusion and during the explosion, vast amounts of hydrogen near the surface are blown off into space. Although, these nebula clouds are mostly remnants after the creation of hydrogen big bang.",Hydrogen,Where does the hydrogen essential for the formation of the Sun came from?
spontaneity of the reaction can be determined from the sign of the gibbs (free) energy. if dG0 reaction is spontaneous in backward direction (from right to left). if reaction is spontaneous in one direction it is non spontaneous in opposite direction.,Spontaneous process,Is a non spontaneous reaction always a reverse reaction?
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating and an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by immune-mediated myelin and axonal damage, and chronic axonal loss attributable to the absence of myelin sheaths. with concomitant degradation of myelin, oligodendrocytes and axons, along with reactive astrogliosis and activated microglia - meaning that there is no only the problem of demzeliniyation but of hzperactive microglia. additional T-cell subsets play a prominent role in MS immunopathology: Th17 cells, CD8+ effector T cells and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. There are different mechanisms for lipid antigen uptake depending upon the antigen source and its structure such that endogenous lipids are differentially distributed in subcellular compartments and internalized lipids are transported to different endocytotic vesicles. Lipids containing alkyl chains that have multiple unsaturation sites or shorter saturated tails are trafficked to early or recycling endosomes [62]; compartments surveyed by CD1c and CD1a that present these types of lipids. Demyelinated plaques and associated astrocytic activation (gliosis) are the results of local inflammation and the major pathological characteristics of the disease.",Myelin,What happens to the myelin sheath and nodes of ranvier?
"pH 7 was chosen as neutral because it's in the center of the pH scale- there are 7 levels above and below it. The meaning of pH is disputed, but the most widely used one is '*p*ower of *H*ydrogen' because pH measures the power, or concentration, of H+ ions in the substance.",PH,Why pH 7 is chosen as neutral?
"Electronegativity is how strongly the element hogs the election ONCE the covalent bond is made. Electropotential is the tendancy of the element to lose/gain electrons (so I see it close to ionization energy/electron affinity definitions). Nevertheless, they are related.",Electronegativity,Do electronegativity and elektrodepotential both describe to what extent an atom can attract electrons?
"The nucleolus is a region in the nucleus where the genes encoding rRNA (for ribosomes) are found. In fact, the structure of the nucleolus relies on transcription of these genes. The rRNA genes are found on several chromosomes. During mitosis, the chromosomes each condense and separate, so clearly the nucleolus can't stay around the whole time during mitosis. I would guess that there is more control to its disassembly though than just the surrounding DNA being pulled away during condensation.",Nucleolus,Why does nucleolus disappear and then reappear again?
"Smooth Muscle Skeletal is voluntary, while cardiac muscle is involuntary (appears striated under the microscope; controls the heart). Smooth Muscle is involuntary as well-smooth muscle is responsible for involuntary movement such as breathing, digestion, peristalsis, and blinking. The diaphragm is responsible for breathing. When it contracts, the lungs are filled with air, and when the diaphragm relaxes, the air is forced from your lungs.",Muscle,What type of muscle is responsible for breathing?
"only a few surface molecules have the required amount of kinetic energy to vaporise, we add heat to the liquid to add kinetic energy to the molecules so that an even larger amount of them vaporise. The latent heat of vaporisation is obtained from the surroundings and this makes the process really slow.",Liquid,How does the entire bulk of a liquid kept in open air evaporate ?
Through transpiration water forms droplets on the surface of the leaves. Those droplets transform into water vapor and leave the plant surface and become part of humidity in the atmosphere. That way water is back to the water cycle.,Water cycle,How would that water continue through the water cycle?
"The brain commands it to move food into esophagus and air into trachea. When you swallow, the muscles pull up on your hyold bone and this makes the larynx up. The epiglottis blocks food from entering your trachea when you are eating. Thats why you shouldnt talk while eating.",Esophagus,How does the body know what to send down the esophagus and what to send down the trachea?
"While a polygenic phenotype can occur without epistasis, if you have epistasis you must be dealing with a polygenic phenotype. Polygenic just means that there are multiple genes involved in a phenotype. Epistasis refers to situations where one allele masks the phenotypic effect of one or more alleles of another gene.",Epistasis,What is the difference between polygenic and epistasis?
"There are different types of neurones in the body, with different locations of the axons and dendrites. The neurone that you are most familiar with are *multipolar* neurones. They make up 99% of all neurones and has 3 or more processes projecting out of the soma. They are the classic example of neurones, with axons carrying information away from the soma and dendrites bringing information back in. The other two types are *bipolar* and *unipolar* neurone. Bipolar neurones has only two processes: an axon and a dendrite. They are found in special sensory places, such as the retina of the eye or the olfactory epithelium. Unipolar neurones have only 1 processes, which contains both the axon and dendrite. They are more common, found in the skin, joints, muscles, and internal organs.",Dendrite,Why the sensory neurons in the ganglia have axons that carry impulses towards the soma instead of dendrites that carry impulses towards the soma?
speed and temperature aren't the same thing. they are related in such way that increase in temperature increases the *average* speed of molecules. real speed can be changed with collisions between two molecules or collisions between molecules and the wall of the container,Temperature,Why is the speed increasing while the temperature is constant?
"Rest of organelles are around the nucleus and the mitotic spindle. Kinetochore makes sure chromosomes attach to the mitotic spindle. regardless of the nucleus, centrosome and centriole make sure that mitosis proceeds as expected.",Organelle,What happens to the rest of the organelles?
"Rest of organelles are around the nucleus and the mitotic spindle. Kinetochore makes sure chromosomes attach to the mitotic spindle. regardless of the nucleus, centrosome and centriole make sure that mitosis proceeds as expected.",Organelle,How does the cell make sure to rapidly attach those chromosomes to the mitotic spindle so they don't float freely or mingle with organelles?
"referring to the tight junctions between endothelial cells in the BBB, glucose and O2 get through because they are able to permeate through the endothelial cells. The cells have glucose transporters and co-transporters that use the driving force of sodium (and sometimes other ions) to help bring glucose into the cells",Glucose,How does the brain get the oxygen and glucose it needs?
"the water at the bottom of the container is less dense, the surface of the water is more dense because of surface tension, the water basically compacts on itself because the water molecules would like to take up the least amount of surface area possible. although the water at the surface is more dense, which allows for the paper clip to sink, on a molecular level, the bottom of the water, is barely less dense than the surface, which is why the paper clip does not float once underneath the surface of the water, and keeps sinking.",Water,What happens to the water at the bottom of the container?
"NaOH does not have a pH, but an aqueous solution of NaOH does. Water contains both H+ and OH- ions. Adding NaOH increases the concentration of OH- ions and decreases the concentration of H+ ions. But there are *always* some H+ ions present, so aqueous NaOH solutions have a pH, usually between 7 and 14.",PH,How can NaOH have a pH scale?
"Antiport means transporting two different molecules in the same time but in opposite direction. Though sodium-potassium pump has an antiport activity, it is not considered as antiporter because it transports sodium(against its concentration gradient) and potassium(down its concentration gradient) in opposite direction but not in the same time.",Sodium–potassium pump,How is the Sodium-Potassium Pump NOT an anti porter?
"'Strong' and 'weak' acids shouldn't be confused with higher or lower pH. What defines a strong acid is that it disassociates completely in water. What defines a weak acid is that it doesn't disassociate completely in water. For example: If a strong acid is in really low concentration(0,00001M) in one solution, and a weak acid is in relatively high concentration(1M) in another, the H+ concentration would probably be higher in the weak acid solution, and it would therefore have lower pH(despite being the weaker acid.)",PH,Can the strength of a base or acid be determined only by its starting pH?
"At a very basic level, in a peroxide, the oxygen has an oxidation number of -1, where in a superoxide, the oxidation number of oxygen is -1/2. To determine whether the anion is a superoxide or peroxide, use the total oxidation number of a compound and the known oxidation numbers of other elements. For example, in KO2, we know that the oxidation number is 0, and K is +1; So we can do 1 + 2O = 0, simple algebra tells us that the oxidation number of the Oxygens is -1/2, which means it is the superoxide anion.",Superoxide,How to determine whether an oxide is superoxide or peroxide?
"You hear a sonic boom when a shock wave passes by you. Individual air particles moving faster than sound do not create a shock wave that can pass by you, just like individual molecules of water do not make a wake.",Sonic boom,Would air particles perform a tiny sonic boom?
"This is an essential cycle that never stops until you die: ADP gets phosphorylated in the mitochondria, storing energy in ATP, and the ATP gets used to perform cellular work, releasing its energy in coupled reactions, and transforming back to ADP.",Adenosine diphosphate,Does ATP transform back to ADP?
"We determine the oxidation state by an agreed upon set of rules. It is just a record keeping system. It is very, very helpful, which is why we use it, but it is still just a group of rules. There are a great many chemicals that for which the oxidation state rules tell use a great deal, but there are also some chemicals where the oxidation state rules don't really help much at all. Here are the rules: (0) Oxidation states can only be integers. (1) the oxidation state of a free element (uncombined element) is 0. There are no exceptions. (2) for a simple (monatomic) ion, the oxidation state is equal to the net charge on the ion. (3) Except in its elemental state, fluorine always has −1. There are no exceptions. (4) Except in its elemental sate, hydrogen has +1, except in hydrides of active metals, e.g. LiH, where it as an oxidation state of −1 (5) Oxygen has a state of −2 except in peroxides and superoxides where it has a state of −1 or when combined with fluorine in which case it has whatever state is needed not to contradict the rule that fluorine must be −1 (usually oxygen will be +2 with fluorine). (6) the algebraic sum of oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule must be zero, while in ions the algebraic sum of the oxidation states of the constituent atoms must be equal to the charge on the ion. (7) Group 1 elements, except in the elemental state, have +1 (8) Group 2 elements, except in the elemental state, have +2 (9) Chlorine, bromine, and iodine, except in the elemental state, have −1 states except where that contradicts the rules for oxygen and fluorine. In compounds containing only chlorine, bromine and/or iodine (e.g. BrCl) then the lower atomic number element will have −1 and the higher atomic number element will have whatever is necessary not to contradict other rules (usually +1).",Oxidation state,How to determine the oxidation state of oxygen?
"When tryptophan levels are low the tryptophan unbinds from tryptophan repressor, which allows transcription of the genes. most chemical reactions (including tryptophan binding as co-repressor to tryptophan repressor) have an equilibrium. In biology, you are typically shown one gene, one repressor, one co-repressor. But you have to imagine the vast majority of biological processes involve 100,000 e.coli cells, each with hundreds or thousands of tryptophan repressor molecules. The more tryptophan present, the more likely it is to bind to one of those repressors and inhibit (reduce) transcription of the gene. The less tryptophan present, the less likely it will bind to the repressor.",Repressor,Does the co-repressor unbind itself from the repressor?
"That would depend on the species that was collapsing. If it was a minor organism, as in one that affected an organism with many other options for energy, the chance of that happening is very low. However, if it was a crucial organism that played a large part in energy sharing for that ecosystem, there could be a possibility of collapse. Once an ecosystem collapses, it is very hard, if not impossible, for it to recover. There might be some ways of restoring the ecosystem, but most ideas, like bringing in invasive species, either don't work or do the opposite of what was planned.",Ecosystem,Would the entire ecosystem recover and how?
"The chromatin structure in plants is fundamentally the same as that in animals, but modern clues have been found that may lead to the discovery of other-and perhaps quite significant-differences.",Chromatin,Does the chromatin of the cell have any significant change?
Two small lungs are simply more effective than one big lung. you can live with one lung but your lifespan will be shortened and your ability to breathe starts weakening. it also weaker than two because the body is then completely dependent on the on lung,Lung,Why do we need two lungs?
"The *vapor pressure* is a property of the substance and is constant at a given temperature. It increases when temperature increases. The *boiling point* of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid. -If you create a vacuum over the liquid you decrease the pressure surrounding the liquid. As soon as it falls below the vapor pressure the liquid will start to boil (you do not have to increase the temperature)! -If you seal the container, the pressure over the liquid will always be the same as the vapor pressure. Thus no matter how much you heat your liquid in order to increase the vapor pressure it will never boil (provided you have a perfect seal and your container can withstand the pressure i.e. it doesn't blow up!). boiling point will increase if you seal the container.",Vapor pressure,What would happen? Would the vapor pressure increase?
"Are all motor proteins found in living creatures? The answer is yes because motor proteins are found in living cells and function them properly. they have varied specific and important roles and they are found in all living cells doing all the things inside the cells. motor proteins are essential proteins for all organisms - they have lots of important roles such as muscle contraction, transporting cargo around the cell and cell motility",Motor protein,Do motor proteins all serve a similar function or can they have many varied or specific roles?
"Secondary succession is when species recolonize the habitat. I do not think that during winter species are _wiped off_ the forest. they do change their behavior action and plant are hidden under the snow, but it does not mean they disappear. If you consider swallow migration to South and then returning to North in the spring, only in that case your definition can apply. Those are migrations and cyclic changes that happen every year regularly (under just one year span) so I am not sure whether we can call it secondary succession.",Secondary succession,Could any forest in the spring recovering from any winter be considered secondary succession?
"Passive transport basically does not require any form of energy compared to active transport. In the case of osmosis,the water moves from areas of HIGH WATER concentration to areas of LOW WATER concentration, which makes it a form of passive transport. It uses no energy to move, it just drifts into lower concentrations of WATER. WATER not other materials, only WATER. Osmosis deals with water.",Active transport,Shouldn't osmosis technically be classified as a form of active transport?
"since tRNA has very long half-life compared to mRNA it is present near ribosome until the end of translation but cannot re-join A site since it does not carry amino acid anymore and there is no hydrolysis of GTO an Ef-Tu factor to bind to help translation. After the translation is over, tRNAs disassemble and after quite a while degrade.",Transfer RNA,Where does the tRNA go?
"The tree of life is a metaphor for the fact that all life on earth is evolutionarily related, somewhat like a huge version of a human family tree. The tree really has nothing to do with physical characteristics such as fur or number of legs. Because evolution allows lineages to change physiologically and anatomically, many pairs of species on earth are quite different. When we look at two species whose members outwardly appear somewhat similar, this is a clue that they share a recent common ancestor. For example, dogs and horses are biologically separate lineages, however they are similar enough (four legs, fur) that it is highly likely that the two lineages split more recently, such as two first cousins who's most recent common ancestor was a grandparent. When we talk about a biological common ancestor, we really mean an ancestral species consisting of many individuals. A ""grandparent population"" that split and became two separate populations, which persisted into becoming modern day dogs and horses. On the other hand, dogs and mosquitoes are very different, which is a clue that their common ancestor diverged into the two lineages a very long time ago, like two distant cousins sharing a great great great great great great grandparent. This ancestral species probably outwardly looked nothing like either a dog or a mosquito. So the whole idea of the tree of life is to convey the idea that all living species, including dogs, horses, and mosquitoes are related, even though some are more closely related than others.",Horse,How would dogs and horses be listed?
"Whenever you swallow something, the muscle contractions pull up on the hyoid bone, which draws the larynx up and tips the epiglottis backwards to cover the opening of the trachea. You can feel part of this process happen if you lightly press on the top of your thyroid cartilage. When you breathe you don't need to swallow the air, so the muscles don't contract and the trachea stays open. All the force driving the air comes from a partial vacuum in the lungs, so it travels through the lower pressure of the trachea rather than the oesophagus.",Trachea,How does the body know what to send down the esophagus and what to send down the trachea?
"Acids come in different strengths. Stronger acids dissociate more, so there is more H+ when they are dissolved in water. Thus, if you have any two acids in water with the same concentration, the pH will be lower (more H+) for the stronger acid. If you happened to have a diprotic acid that was just a little bit weaker than your monoprotic acid, it might be that the diprotic acid's double dissociation to give H+ just added up to match that of the monoprotic acid's single dissociation and they could have the same pH.",Acid,Does ph of a monoprotic acid and a diprotic acid is same?
"In mitosis, the parent cell is diploid, which means that they will have 46 chromosomes (2n). The resulting 2 daughter cells are identical to each other and the parent cell, so they will also have 46 chromosomes (diploid; 2n). This is different for meiosis [the parent cell has 46 chromosomes and the 4 resulting daughter cells each have 23 chromosomes (haploid)]",Chromosome,How many chromosomes does each daugher cell have after cell division is complete?
"Passive transport basically does not require any form of energy compared to active transport. In the case of osmosis,the water moves from areas of HIGH WATER concentration to areas of LOW WATER concentration, which makes it a form of passive transport. It uses no energy to move, it just drifts into lower concentrations of WATER. WATER not other materials, only WATER. Osmosis deals with water.",Passive transport,Is osmosis also passive transport for water?
"That would depend on the species that was collapsing. If it was a minor organism, as in one that affected an organism with many other options for energy, the chance of that happening is very low.

There might be some ways of restoring the ecosystem, but most ideas, like bringing in invasive species, either don't work or do the opposite of what was planned.",Ecosystem collapse,Would the entire ecosystem collapse?
"Water is what is considered a 'permeability exception'. This is because water is polar, however it still diffuses readily through the hydrophobic core via osmosis. It does so by undergoing something called a ""Dipole moment"" wherein the unequal charge distribution of the molecule disappears just long enough to cross the membrane. However, from a basic perspective people will still say that water is impermeable due to its polarity and it diffuses very slowly.",Hydrophobe,How can water pass through the hydrophobic part of the cell?
"mRNAs typically have a fairly short lifetime, but mRNAs can be (and usually are) translated multiple times. Sometimes an mRNA is even translated by multiple ribosomes simultaneously! (The structure formed when this happens is called a polysome.) One of many types of regulation that happens within cells is at the level of mRNA stability.",Messenger RNA,Can the mRNA be translated again?
this is the case with a plant cell that has a rigid cell wall thus in a fixed volume hydrostatic pressure will increase until osmotic pressure is opposed. But with an RBC the volume is not fixed (due to lack of cell wall) so osmotic pressure increases unopposed until the cell lyses.,Cell (biology),"Why doesn't the pressure of the cell (even a red blood cell that isn't rigid), balance out the net inflow?"
"Technically, the mucus has two routes--it can either slide down the throat, or it can be ejected (when we sneeze or blow our nose) out the airway. If it is ejected, then that takes care of that as far as the body is concerned. If it slides down to the stomach, then our stomach acids can (hopefully) kill the germs contained within. As to your question, ""Why hasn't the body evolved [differently]..."", that's a bit more philosophical. From an evolutionary standpoint, there probably isn't enough of a reproductive disadvantage to warrant such an adaptation.

that single electron has greater chance of forming a bond (pi bond) if the orbital he is in isn't hybridized. paired electrons don't have to bond so their orbital gets hybridized (it lowers the total energy of the molecule),Electron,Why lone pairs of electrons have their own hybridized orbitals?
"There is no difference between acting as an enzyme and being an enzyme. Ribosomes are a complexes that contain multiple proteins (~60 in prokaryotes, ~80 in eukaryotes) and several RNAs. Many of these rRNAs have enzymatic activity, but the proteins are primarily there to support and regulate the rRNAs. So, you could call a ribosome an enzyme, but really it is a complex containing several enzymes .",Enzyme,Is the ribosome an enzyme or does it just ACT as an enzyme?
"rock in the inner core would be even older than anything in our crust, except having to access to the unbelievable heat and pressure. moon is believed to have come it the early days when a mars size asteroid smashed into earth before the hadian eon, and all the debris gravitated together (after forming a temporary ring) and turning into the moon.",Moon,Could the Moon have been of Earth?
"If there was an un-hybridized lone pair, then it would be in a p orbital. This would leave the bonding electrons in sp2 hybrid orbitals, which are involved in the N-H bond. However, according to VSEPR theory, these regions of electron density would like to place them selves as far as they can away from each other, or create the largest bond angle possible, which would be difficult due to the lone pair in a p orbital which orients it self perpendicular to the atom (90degrees). In other words, if all orbitals are hybrid orbitals, then the regions of electron density would be able to be as far apart as possible, creating a bond angle of around 107degrees.",Lone pair,Why do lone pairs of electrons form hybrid orbitals?
"We know because of the magnetic field. Theoretically, we can't prove the existence of the core of the earth but there is no other way that the magnetic field of the earth and other planets are possible. It even explains the lack of magnetic field for things like the moon or Mars. Everything in science is a theory. We have seismic data that suggests there is something very dense at the center of the earth. We know that the core gives off heat. It makes sense that the heaviest elements would go to the center of the planet as the planet formed.",Earth,What proof is available to support Earth (or any other planet in solar system) has a core?
"You inhale much more oxygen than you actually use. Some of it goes to red blood cells swapping it for CO2, but most of the excess O2 is just exhaled. This is what allows CPR to work - there's still a lot of leftover oxygen in the exhaled air.",Oxygen,Does oxygen that had not been used up escape?
"When the sodium ions move down their concentration gradient, the antiporter uses the energy transferred to it to change its shape so that it can accept the other molecules and push them in the opposite direction, against their concentration gradient. You can sort of think of the sodium ions going through the antiporter like taking your hand out of a glove and turning it inside out (and stretching it out), it is then ready to accept a hand going into it (the opposite direction) and help it in by using the stored energy from when your hand stretched it.",Antiporter,How do the molecules moving down their concentration gradient in a antiporter provide the energy for the others to move in the opposite direction?
"understand that 'species' is a human construct that doesn't have an exact match in nature. What actual exist are breeding populations in a given area. We may or may not classify them as the same species as some other similar breeding population somewhere else. What we usually, but not always, use as a dividing mark between species is whether the members continue to interbreed given the opportunity. If they cannot or will not normally breed, we tend to call them different species. If they are distinctly different but can and do naturally interbreed given the chance, we tend to call them different subspecies.",Subspecies,Are they consider a different species or a subspecies?
"During the flat bit of the phase transition diagram, where temperature doesn't change despite the addition of more heat, the ice is melting and there is a mixture of ice and liquid water.

"Atom have 4 electrons in the outermost shell can actually choose either or even stay neutral. One interesting thing about these types of subshells, is that they are actually somewhat stable. Because of the relative stability, these atoms often form covalent bonds rather than ionic bonds that need a charge. One example is Carbon. It has 4 valence electrons, so it can make a 4+ or a 4- charge. But because of its relatively stable half filled orbital, most of the time it takes part in covalent bonding like in organic molecules. On occasion, Carbon can ionize, most commonly 4+.",Electron,Will atom need to gain 4 electrons or lose 4 electrons to achieve an octet?
"When an element is bonded to another atom of itself, that contribute 0 to its oxidation state. So, in other words, you just ignore the bond an atom makes to another atom of itself. So, in hydrogen peroxide we have: H-O-O-H. The O-O bond doesn't count. So each O is bonded to one H. Since H has an oxidation state of +1, O must cancel that out, so its oxidation number is −1.",Oxygen,Does the oxygen bonded with another oxygen don't count as another oxidation state?
"Archea and Bacteria branched before the Eukarya appeared. Only after Archea and Bacteria branched did the Eukarya branch off from Archea.

And using DNA hybridization and things Evolutionists hypothesized this, though there really is no proof.",Eukaryote,"If before, from which of these domains did Eukarya branch?"
"gas giants aren't failed stars, that is a common but false myth. Here is the reason the gas giants are gas giants: there used to be gas throughout the solar system, when it was a nebula. As planets grew in size, they collected gas in the form of atmospheres. However, as the SUN grew, most of the gas was blown away by the subsequent solar wind and radiation. The closer you get, the stronger it is. That's why Mercury has practically no atmosphere, and the gas giants are so large. In addition, most gas giants have solid rocky cores on the inside, and those are, in fact, larger than Earth. This means they have a greater gravitational field, counteracting the solar wind. In short: a combination of large cores and distance from the Sun allowed Gas Giants to stay gassy, while rocky planets like mercury, Mars, Venus, or earth lost most or all of that gas to solar wind.",Gas giant,Did gas giants and sun form in different ways?
"Water vapourizes at 100 degrees celsius but evaporates at a lower temperature. Vapourization is the change from liquid to gas at a fixed or definite temperature whereas evaporation is the change from liquid to gas at a variable temperature. the boiling temperature is the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the atmospheric pressure. If heat is added, the liquid will start to boil and bubbles of vapour can withstand the atmospheric pressure and escape the liquid. High up in the mountains, atmospheric pressure is low. The boiling temperature of water is only 93  degree Celsius at 2000 metres. the mercury boiling point is around 357 degree C, but evaporation can happen all the time, slowly, on the surface, as the particles get enough energy to separate themselves from the forces of attraction that hold them together.",Boiling point,Should none of the water evaporate because the boiling point of water is 100 Celsius?

"Take honey for example, it is very viscous, but when it is heated it flows better. it's properties change. The heat from the fire or wherever it was heated from increased it's energy. When it was able to flow better, there is an increase in kinetic energy, making it less viscous than it usually is. Same goes for freezing. Since there is little, or almost no movement there is less kinetic energy and more potential. making it very viscous, and would almost not leave it's container",Viscosity,How will the viscosity of liquid be affected by increase in temperature?
"Active transport is a process that uses energy from respiration. Diffusion and osmosis don't require the cell to expend any of its own energy, as they are passive processes. Diffusion is the spreading out of particles in a *gas or solution* resulting in the *net* movement of these particles from an area of *higher* concentration to an area of *lower* concentration Osmosis is the movement of *water* particles from a *dilute* solution to a *more* concentrated solution through a *selectively permeable membrane* As we know both are passive processes and yet (in basic, short terms) diffusion is higher to lower and osmosis is lower to higher, so movement to concentration doesn't determine whether it is active or passive.",Active transport,Shouldn't Osmosis technically be classified as a form of active transport?
"Prokaryotes are organisms with prokaryotic cells. They are either of two kingdoms of bacteria. They are distinguished by their cells, which don't contain a nucleus or complex organelles like those of animals, plants, etc. do. There are so many differing species of prokaryotes that it's kind of hard to answer the question of what they do. Some prokaryotes help with the digestion process of animals, some are resistant to heat, cold, salt, etc., and some cause diseases.",Prokaryote,What is the role of prokaryotes?
"Voltage and current sources generate both voltage and current. The difference between them lies in which parameter (voltage or current) is being controlled. A constant voltage source (like a battery) is designed to generate a controlled voltage. When you put a constant voltage source in a circuit, the voltage across its terminals is always a constant value. Depending on what it is connected to, a voltage source provides (generates) whatever current is needed to keep the voltage on its terminals constant. Example: a 1.5 V battery connected to a 100 ohm resistor will generate a current of 1.5/100 = 15 mA. If you change the resistor to 10 ohms, the voltage will still be 1.5 V but the voltage source will now generate a current of 1.5/10 = 150 mA. Current sources may seem a little strange, but they behave exactly like a voltage source, but with current being controlled. A constant current source is designed to generate a controlled current. When you put a current source in a circuit, the current through the source is always a constant value. Depending on what it is connected to, a current source provides whatever voltage is needed to keep the current on its terminals constant. Example: suppose you have a constant current source set to current = 1 mA. If you connect a 100 ohm resistor across the current source, the voltage will be V = 1 mA x 100 ohms = 0.1 V. If you change the resistor to 1000 ohms, the current will still be 1 mA and the voltage generated by the current source will rise to V = 1 mA x 1000 ohms = 1 V. Most transistors (MOSFET, Bipolar) and the old vacuum tubes have a region of operation where they act just like a current source.",Voltage,Don't a voltage source and a current source both supply a current and voltage in a circuit?
"strong acid and bases giving 100% ionization in water has to do with equilibrium and reversible reactions. When an acid or base dissociates (or ionizes) in water, there's always the possibility of the reverse reaction, were the ions react to reform the not-dissociated acid or base. The amount an acid or base dissociates in water has to do with how much more one of these reactions is favored the forward reaction (the dissociation into ions), or the backward reaction (the ions reacting to form the original acid or base). Strong acids and bases almost overwhelmingly favor the forward reaction, because the resulting ions are relatively unreactive in aqueous solution.",Acid strength,Why do strong acid and bases give 100% ionization?

"In this theory, RNA came first. RNA can do everything it needs to do: selfreproduce, catalyze reactions, regulate - all of which it still does today to different degrees. Since RNA is chemically relatively simple and doesn't have many different structural elements (only its 4 bases and its repeating backbone), it could be produced by natural chemical processes on some kind of matrix (which helps keeping the molecules in place so that they can get larger and larger till RNA happens). Metallic clay in shallow water is a great contender for that matrix. This is pretty uncontroversial amongst proponents of Abiogenesis, but after that point scholars are divided on what happened next - did DNA come next as more stable storage medium of information (this is most likely since DNA and RNA are closely related chemically and we know for a fact that RNA can handle DNA) or did RNA develop the ability to make proteins (also not impossible since we know for a fact that amino acids can be made by chemical processes not involving life and RNA is today heavily involved in making proteins). Once you have all three, no matter what comes first after RNA, the next threshold of complexity, the first cell, is a comparatively easy step.",RNA,Did RNA exist before cells?
"If you look at the periodic table, you can see Cadmium (Cd) belongs to the 12th group. The periodic table is organized so that the 2 in '12' is equivalent to the amount of electrons the element has in its valence shell. That means Cadmium has 2 electrons in its valence shell. An atom of Cadmium has an oxidation of 2+ because it tends to lose those 2 electrons in its valence shell in order to stabilize, therefore having a positive charge of 2",Cadmium,"How can cadmium, an element that is somewhere around the middle of the periodic table, have an oxidation state of +2?"

"The air is forced in and out of our lungs via the diaphragm. The diaphragm is an involuntary muscle but can be controlled. Lungs are controlled by involuntary muscles, but can also be controlled via voluntary muscles. So under 'normal' conditions they are controlled via the involuntary muscles, i.e subconscious/with-out thinking, and voluntary when we try to control the rate we are breathing, so we use our abdomen muscles to 'mold' the lungs into a smaller shape, thus slowing down the breathing rate, or holding your breath while swimming, etc. As to your second question, either way you are still getting air in, however by breathing via your 'stomach' it allows for more air to be breathed in, compared to breathing via your 'chest', thus allowing for more gas exchange, due to the increase in surface area : volume ratio, other than that, I don't believe there is anything 'better'. Apparently it also allows you to 'sing' and speak better, and for longer bursts before having to breath again",Lung,Are lungs controlled in a voluntary or involuntary manner?
"Bacteria does do most of the work but animals degrade the whale *faster*. Bacteria Breaks down the carcass slower than the animals and organisms.

"Oxygen in the air is usually in the form of O2, which is stable. Oxygen in water is bound to two hydrogens, which makes it stable as well - at least as far as connecting more oxygen to them goes. Oxygen can diffuse into water, but this happens very slowly if the water is still. It doesn't bond, it is a mixture. The oxygen can come back out as well. Agitation (movement) of the water will increase it's absorption of air. Water can also contain other substances through *pressure* and *solubility*. Oxygen can be pushed into water so that it is absorbed under pressure - given room to expand, the oxygen comes back out of the water and into the air. Henry's Law explains gas absorption into water, which involves a bit of chemistry. Water is what we call a solvent - it can absorb other substances because the oxygen is connected to the hydrogens by what are called ionic bonds, which leaves the oxygen with a negative charge and the two hydrogens with a positive charge, and these charges can pull other molecules like salt apart.",Oxygen,Why don't the oxygen atoms in the air bond to the water molecules on the surface and pull on water molecules?
"When you titrate HCl against Na2CO3, the reaction proceeds in two steps. The first step involves the production of NaHCO3 and this step has an equivalence point of about pH 8.3, in the range covered by phenolphthalein. Hence, the phenolphthalein changes colour at this first equivalence point. As more acid is dripped in, the NaHCO3 reacts to liberate CO2. The equivalence point for this second step is pH 3.7. However, the phenolphthalein has already changed colour so you will not detect this second equivalence point when using phenolphthalein. The way around this is to use a different indicator, such as methyl orange, that doesn't change colour until the second equivalence point is reached, at which point the reaction has gone to completion.",Titration,Why doesn't a titration of HCL against Na2CO3 go to completion?

"Humans probably can make up for some the biodiversity that we lose is synthetics ways and stuff like that, but that doesn't take care of the all of the problems. For one thing, plants do a very good job performing photosynthesis. I don't think humans have ever found away to convert energy into food. Even if we have or possibly can it's probably not as efficient as a plant's photosynthesis and it would hard to reproduce that process on a scale large enough to feed millions of people. Also, plants are at the bottom of the food chains and if we lose plants we lose all other kind of living organisms. Another effect losing biodiversity has is on the climate and cycles of water, carbon, nitrogen etc. Our climate gets messed up when the ecosystem is messed up (and our ecosystem gets messed up when the climate gets messed up...). Also,the problem with losing some biodiversity and trying to get along with only some other species is they are all inter-related in very complicated ways, and I don't think we fully understand them all. We have a intricate balance and if that gets messed up we might have more problems than we can predict. However, as we do lose biodiversity, we might have to do more with creative solution that don't make us depend on other species. But that isn't the best solution and preserving the environment, in the end, the most productive and cost-effective solution.",Species,Do humans need to protect other species or can we do without?
"If complex 2 got the electrons first then moving the electrons to complex 1 would 'uphill' (endergonic)! the point of these reactions is to create as large a ""proton"" gradient (PMF) as possible (by pumping as many H+ across the membrane as possible). complex 2 is designed to ignore NADH and thus more of the energy associated with the electrons in NADH is converted into energy stored in the PMF.",Electron,Is not complex 2 supposed to have more ability to gain electrons?

"New genetic traits occurring that are not the result of novel gene combinations happen by mutations. These mutations happen as the gametes are forming. This is not all that unusual, most gametes have a few mutations. Most of the time the mutation has little or no effect on the phenotype. When there is an effect that matters, it is usually harmful. But, once in a while, the mutation is beneficial. There are many kinds of mutations. This is gene duplication. In gene duplication the offspring gets an extra copy of a gene, perhaps even on a completely different chromosome. Sometimes this is catastrophic, but a lot of times it can enhance an existing trait or simply just provide a backup copy of an existing gene. Gene duplication is a very common mutation and there are many genes we have extra copies of. Now, if we have a spare copy of a gene, then some of the time that allows a major mutation to occur in one of the copies without causing a catastrophic problem. Now, in particular, if one of the copies undergoes what is called a frameshift mutation, then that gene will now code for a completely different protein. This might do very little, might be harmful, or might actually cause a new trait to appear rather suddenly. There are documented cases of this kind of mutation.",Gene,"How to account for 'new' traits, and not just novel gene combinations?"

"The net inflow of water when the cell is placed in a hypotonic solution does not require energy. However, net inflow is not because there is room to move around. Individual water molecules move around randomly. They enter the cell because that was the direction they were traveling in. The number of water molecules is so high, that their individual random paths average out. This is why diffusion tends to keep the quantities of water on both sides equal. When there is more water on one side, there is a greater chance that more of it will leave the area of high concentration then enter it, balancing it out. However, in a hypotonic solution, there is more solute inside the cell than outside. The probability for each individual water molecule to leave the cell is greatly decreased. Therefore, there needs to be much more water inside the cell than outside, for the amount of water leaving the cell to be equal to the amount of water entering it. Until that point is reached however, the amount o f water inside the cell will increase until the cell lyses or the amount of water entering and exiting the cell equalizes.",Cell (biology),"Why doesn't the pressure of the cell (even a red blood cell that isn't rigid), balance out the net inflow?"
