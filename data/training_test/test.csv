"The molecules can't get out of the way fast enough when you hit the water from a height without diving into it, so they exert a force that your body perceives as pain. It' not the surface tension as such, but the hydrogen bonds that hold the molecules together in the liquid.",Surface tension,Is surface tension responsible for the pain felt by a person?
"the charge is a natural property of protons and electrons. It does not appear to come from anywhere, it just exists. An electrical charge can be defined as the natural property of certain kinds of matter that cause their paths of motion to be deflected when exposed to a magnetic field. When electrical charges were first discovered, one of type of charge was arbitrarily called ""negative"" and the other type was arbitrarily called positive. Since the two types of charge tend to cancel each other out, picking one to call negative and the other to call positive is a reasonable convention.",Proton,What gives an electron a negative charge and what gives a proton a positive charge?
"Certain Plants do grow better around each other and help each other out. Researcher Dr. David Johnson looked closely at plants' symbiotic relationship with soil fungus, piggybacking off a 2010 study that seemed to suggest that a tomato plant infected with leaf blight would be able to warn nearby plants of the problem. In turn, those plants would activate genes that would prevent them from catching the disease, too. Johnson was able to show how plants use fungus in the soil as a network (think of it as a botanical Wi-Fi, if you will). Essentially, fungi deliver messages of danger from plant to plant, and as a result, the group can grow stronger. Even plants get by with a little help from their friends. *Animals* help plants by pollinating them, and be helping to disperse seeds. The droppings of animals also fertilize plants. Plants have three basic responses or reactions to light. They are photosynthesis, phototropism and photoperiodism. As plants react/respond to light the amount of heat wont matter anyway.",Plant,How plants respond to nature?
"animals have different gut bacteria than us. they have other opportunistic bacteria and the first line of defense. Also, some zoonosis is exclusive to humans not shared with animals.",Bacteria,Wouldn't bacteria in the water cause illness towards animals?
"Most indicators don't change color significantly after you go out of their useful range. This appears to be also true for Bromothymol Blue, which google image searching suggests just becomes a darker shade of blue as the solution gets more basic at least as far as pH 14",Color,Does the colour goes away?
The N-terminus of a protein is synthesized first. Each new amino acid is added by making a bond between the carboxyl group at the end of the growing polypeptide and the amino group of the amino acid that is being added.,N-terminus,Is the N-terminus or C-terminus formed first?
"First of all, birds do not sleep as long as we humans and therefore do not spend too much time in the same position. Second, birds are fairly smaller animals, therefore, their oxygen daily intake is much smaller than compared to us humans.",Bird,How do the birds survive while trees release carbon dioxide during the night?
"Passive transport basically does not require any form of energy compared to active transport. In the case of osmosis,the water moves from areas of HIGH WATER concentration to areas of LOW WATER concentration, which makes it a form of passive transport. It uses no energy to move, it just drifts into lower concentrations of WATER. WATER not other materials, only WATER. Osmosis deals with water.",Passive transport,Why would osmosis be a form of Passive Transport?
We cant treat light the same way we treat matter because daily things travel very slowly but when you are travelling at speeds beyond 10^6 ms^-1 the science is different matter and energy are interconvertible (e=mc^2) so it doesn't really store energy it is energy itself.,Energy,Where does the photon store energy?
The lungs are functionally like a balloon that fills the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm (which is skeletal muscle) and some other muscles change the volume of the thoracic cavity this changes the pressure and causes inhalation and exhalation. What changes is what it is controlled by for voluntary functions the cerebral cortex is taking over but normally breathing centers of the medulla oblongata and pons control involuntary breathing.,Skeletal muscle,Would the lungs be an Involuntary or Voluntary muscle?
"Like the reason we are made up of many different cells versus one big cell. Absorption by little cells is much more efficient than large cells. So you have the two smaller lungs and they are divided into even smaller bronchioles and they are covered in villi to maximize surface area. One big lung wouldn't be as efficient at maximizing surface area. Plus, there is always an advantage to redundancy. You can lose one lung to damage or disease and continue to live but one big lung would be at risk.",Lung,Why do we need two lungs?
"Metabolism definitely varies between people. Metabolism can be defined as the sum of all of the chemical reactions occurring inside of a living organism. Metabolism varies depending on the conditions present inside of the organism. The human body can speed up and slow down the rates of different chemical processes simultaneously in an attempt to maintain homeostasis. So weight can affect metabolism, but it certainly isn't the only factor that does so. A person's activity level, hormone levels, age, energy intake, and overall health can also impact metabolism.",Metabolism,Does metabolism vary widely between people?
"the soil, the atmosphere has salt. Hydro-logical cycle is no difference. It is all harmonised and synchronised so water actually picks up salt form soil as well as atmospheric waters pick up salt nuclei from the atmosphere and bring down to the ocean.",Salt,How is salt in the water?
"presently all cells come from other cells - this means that any existing cell got the ribosomes it begins with from a progenitor cell, so any protein (including new ribosomal proteins) will initially be made by a ribosome that came from a progenitor cell. Enzymes can also be made from RNA and RNA is actually still used to catalyze some critical cellular processes such as translation. These observations led to the hypothesis that there was an ""RNA world"" in which RNA served to both store information (like DNA does now) and to catalyze reactions (as is now usually done by proteins).",Ribosome,Does Ribosome exists first or Protein does?
"Interestingly enough, so-called idiot savants, do not have a greater capacity for computation, music, or art. Instead, the parts of their brains responsible for such tasks dominate the rest of their brain because the parts that would normally compete for attention are either damaged or unable to communicate effectively with the rest of the brain. Researchers have used something called TMS (trans-cranial magnetic stimulation) to induce small currents in parts of the brain, either shutting down or activating specific regions of the brain temporarily. Their research has shown that it is possible to temporarily induce a savant-like state in normally functioning brains. And, of course, some forms of brain damage can induce temporary or permanent savant-like states as well.",Intelligence,Does human beings have the capacity to use all areas of cerebral cortex or only few designated areas?
"We cannot obtain usable nitrogen through breathing. Nitrogen has to be fixed into a usable form first before it is consumed by heterotrophs. We can't take in nitrogen in the atmosphere because it is N2. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria converts the N2 into ammonium (NH4), which gets converted into nitrates (NO3) and nitrites (NO2-). Plants can take this form in, and help convert nitrogen into amino acids/proteins and nucleic acids.",Nitrogen,Do we also breathe in the nitrogen in the atmosphere and do we take in this nitrogen?
"the water at the bottom of the container is less dense, the surface of the water is more dense because of surface tension, the water basically compacts on itself because the water molecules would like to take up the least amount of surface area possible.although the water at the surface is more dense, which allows for the paper clip to sink, on a molecular level, the bottom of the water, is barely less dense than the surface, which is why the paper clip does not float once underneath the surface of the water, and keeps sinking.",Paper clip,"Why does a paperclip that is able to sink below the surface, go down to the bottom?"
The only way to increase the kinetic energy of the electrons is to increase the frequency. If the frequency remains constant. the kinetic energy is also constant. The amplitude of a wave does not affect its frequency. Two waves of different amplitude can have the same frequency.,Kinetic energy,Why does the current not increase when the kinetic energy increases?
Some molecules will speed up and some will slow down as they collide with each other or with the container walls. But with such gigantic numbers of molecules (~10^23) everything will average out if temperature stays the same and you won't see any change in the shape of the graph with time.,Graph (discrete mathematics),After a while would the graph for the same system be different?
"'Atomic weight' is an older term and should not be used. 'Atomic mass' is the correct term if you are talking about amu/atom. 'Molecular mass' is the correct term if you are talking about amu/molecule. If you are talking about grams of the element or molecules, the term is 'molar mass' (has units of g/mol).",Atomic mass,what is the difference if atomic weight and atomic mass are not the same thing?
"an air particle is not able to produce a compression of waves to generate a sonic boom. First of all, they change the direction many times per second... And like Matt B and Quantum Particle explained, an air particle is part of the medium itself. If it was a mental experiment, you could say that a tiny particle with a huge mass (and thus a huge density) can create a tiny sonic boom. But still there is the fact if some particle will be able to generate a compression... A compression is needed for the boom. Due to the size of the particle will it generate a compression or only hit in the particles? And what is the source of the sound? The particle will be able to disturb the air in such way that generates sound? even a particle with huge density will not be able to generate a sonic boom.",Sonic boom,Would air particles perform a tiny sonic boom?
"Osmosis and dissolving are different processes! Dissolving is what happens when molecules or ions in a crystal (or other solid) disperse within a solution. For example, if I put salt or sugar into a cup of water it dissolves - note that there is no semi-permeable membrane involved. In contrast, osmosis is the tendency for water (or another solvent) to move across a semi-permeable membrane to decrease differences in solute concentration.",Osmosis,Salt was dissolved in the digestive system so why would osmosis need to dissolve it again when diffusing the salt?
"Lithium is a stronger reducing agent than all other alkali metals. This is because Lithium (do note that all this is happening in water) has a large hydration energy (because of its small size and high charge density), and this favours the formation of the Li+ cation significantly, making Li the best reducing agent in the periodic table (and amongst alkali metals).",Lithium,How come Li has more reduction potential than Na or K?
"electron is itself a fundamental negative particle while protonic positive charge is due to presence of 3 quarks in it neutron also has 3 quarks but no charge. The electron is a subatomic particle that carries a negative electric charge. It has no known substructure and is believed to be a point particle Electrons participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. Like its rest mass and elementary charge, the intrinsic angular momentum (or spin) of an electron has a constant value. In the collision of an electron and a positron, the electron's antiparticle, both are annihilated. An electron-positron pair can be produced from gamma ray photons with sufficient energy.",Electron,What gives an electron a negative charge and what gives a proton a positive charge?
"sexual reproduction evolved via natural selection. Some very primitive form of sexual reproduction (probably just sharing DNA randomly between single cells) led to greater variation in one population vs another. On a population scale, sexual reproduction clearly offers a selective advantage. The new-found variation means that the population as a whole can thrive in a wider variety of conditions because individuals are less similar to each other and the population as a whole can therefore survive in a wider variety of conditions. For example, let's say there is a population of cells that normally can survive in only dry, hot conditions. Let's say that through random mutation (which is pretty rare), one member of that population develops an allele of a gene that allows it to survive in humid conditions, and another member develops an allele of a different gene that allows it to survive in cold conditions. If the population can only reproduce asexually (i.e. by budding off clones), you would never find an individual that could survive both humidity AND cold. So, if the desert where this population of cells lives cooled AND humidified (maybe there's an ice age), none of the individuals of that asexually reproducing population would survive. BUT, if they did reproduce sexually, there could be an individual with BOTH new alleles who could survive both cold AND humidity. So in this scenario, sexual reproduction is a selective advantage over asexual reproduction. However, the original version of sexual reproduction was probably very, very simple compared to how it works in humans - remember, our version of sexual reproduction has had a ton of time to evolve its complexities.",Sexual reproduction,Why/how was sexual reproduction introduced?
Human heart is a pumping organ which pumps the blood. Whole of the body. And deoxygenated blood require The pressure. To move into the alveoli. The blood does go to the heart to get oxygenated. From the right ventricle the blood goes to the lungs which uses diffusion to separate CO2 from O2. Then it goes to the left atrium to get pumped to the body.,Blood,Why do blood go to the heart if they need oxygen?
"you cannot heat steam 'forever'. Like all molecules, when sufficiently hot it will decompose. There is not a set temperature at which it decomposes, it is more of a gradual process as the temperature increases. You start getting significant quantities of water decomposing at around 2500 K. At about 3000 K you get around 50% of water molecules decomposing. Of course, this is a rather hot temperature and it is rather impractical to generate, much less create a container to house the reaction.",Temperature,Is there a limit to that the steam will get hotter?
"The rays which came from the positive side are called anode rays (as they were thought to originate from the anode) and were thought to consist of positively charged particles, though it has been proved that the particles are actually those of the ionized gas present in the discharge tube.",Anode,Are the anode rays only nuclei?
