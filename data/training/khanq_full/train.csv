"Neurons are the most unique cells in our body. Some are extremely small, while others are very large. In general, neurons do not repair well. If several neurons were damaged, such as in a spinal cord injury, you already know the individual would be paralyzed and it is unlikely the individual would ever walk again. If a portion of a neuron is damaged, it may or may not be able to find and re-connect with itself. If the axon is damaged, the myelin cells such as Schwann cells form a tunnel to help direct the axon to the other portion. Never-the-less, even after several years, if you touch an area of your body that has a scar, you will realize that touch or feeling over that scar has changed and it is not as sensitive as it once was because the receptors and axons were damaged when the skin was damaged. Now, even though the skin is well healed, the nervous tissue has not healed and therefore the sense of touch is poor over that scar. Epithelial tissue and connective tissue heal well, but nervous tissue does not have the ability to divide and replace neurons that have been damaged so it does not heal well.",Neuron,Can neurons be healed?
"HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper T cells , macrophages, and dendritic cells.",Immune system,How do the innate and adaptive cells of the immune systems lose their functions?
"tetrahedral e.g. carbon at the centre of the tetrahedron, hydrogens at the four vertices. Trigonal pyramidal e.g. nitrogen at a vertex of the triangular pyramid (apex of pyramid), hydrogens at the vertices of the triangular base of pyramid. A tetrahedron is a regular triangular pyramid. But the way the word ""tetrahedral"" is used is different from what you normally think of when you picture a tetrahedron. They say that CH4 (methane) has a tetrahedral shape. Now, you may think the four C-H bonds form a tetrahedron, but that's wrong: they don't. If you join the four hydrogen atoms with straight lines, you'd get a tetrahedron in that case. Trigonal pyramidal, on the other hand, is different. They might say NH3 is trigonal pyramidal, by which they mean that the 3 N-H bonds form three sides of a triangular pyramid, where the N is the apex of the pyramid. The triangular ""base"" of the pyramid is formed by the three H atoms joined to each other. I don't want to confuse you, but trigonal pyramidal shaped NH3 has a tetrahedral ""geometry"".",Tetrahedron,How is trigonal pyramidal different from tetrahedral?
"Anabolic reactions are defined as biological reactions that create more complex (larger) molecules. Anabolic reactions are endergonic (store energy). Anabolic reactions do use energy harvested from catabolic processes, but that is not typically part of the definition of anabolism.",Anabolism,Does anabolism and catabolism is a cyclic process?
"A positively charged carbon would normally have three other atoms bonded to it still, have 3 groups: one sigma bond to hydrogen, and two sigma bonds to the carbons. 3 groups need 3 hybrid orbitals, so we add 3 atomic orbitals (s+p+p) to get 3 hybrid sp2 hybrid orbitals. Carbocations are sp2 hybridized. ",Orbital hybridisation,What will be its hybridization state?
"Sodium chloride ionic compounds form a gigantic lattice structure due to the electrostatic attractions between the individual ions. In this case, each sodium ion is surrounded by 4 chloride ions and each chloride ion is surrounded by 4 sodium ions and so on and so on, so that the result is a massive crystal. This particular ratio of Na ions to Cl ions is due to the ratio of electrons interchanged between the 2 atoms",Sodium chloride,Why cannot there be a single molecule of NaCl?
"Once one molecule gets a slightly positive side and a slightly negative side, it will induce polarisation in it's neighbours. So the positive end will attract the electron density from the neighbouring molecule, which in turn then gets a negative end and a positive end, etc. Repulsive forces don't induce each other, so you just get attraction.",Coulomb's law,Why aren't repulsive forces just as likely as attractive ones?
"The hormones are considered Intracellular, the reaction occurs within the cell, Intercellular refers to when the reaction occurs externally between two cells.",Hormone,Would hormones be considered intercellular signals or intracellular signals?
"boiling point will change, that has a lot to do with atmospheric pressure, and that is why in some places it takes a higher heat to boil or in others a lower heat to boil. Also about that topic it can take a longer time to boil or shorter based on atmospheric pressure, but that has more to do with pressure than heat.",Boiling point,Will the boiling point change?
"During the flat bit of the phase transition diagram, where temperature doesn't change despite the addition of more heat, the ice is melting and there is a mixture of ice and liquid water. Only when the last bit of ice has melted, and all the water is liquid, does the temperature start to rise.",Water,Does one classify the H2O molecules as solid or liquid?
"Water vapourizes at 100 degrees celsius but evaporates at a lower temperature. Vapourization is the change from liquid to gas at a fixed or definite temperature whereas evaporation is the change from liquid to gas at a variable temperature. the boiling temperature is the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the atmospheric pressure. If heat is added, the liquid will start to boil and bubbles of vapour can withstand the atmospheric pressure and escape the liquid. High up in the mountains, atmospheric pressure is low. The boiling temperature of water is only 93  degree Celsius at 2000 metres. the mercury boiling point is around 357 degree C, but evaporation can happen all the time, slowly, on the surface, as the particles get enough energy to separate themselves from the forces of attraction that hold them together.",Boiling point,Should none of the water evaporate because the boiling point of water is 100 Celsius?
"magnetism is generated in the core via different methods than permanent magnets. in the core, magnetism is generated by the outer core as it rotates slower than the solid inner core thus generating huge amounts of frictional energy and kicking electrons of the iron and nickel molecules generating a magnetic field. this method is not affected by high temperatures but slows in lower temperatures. it is known that one day, the Earth will cool and the inner core will melt so the friction between the cores reduces and so does the strength of the magnetic field.",Magnetism,Why the earth doesn't looses its magnetic property?
"The energy is not distributed among multiple electrons. For the photon to be absorbed, it has to match the energy change corresponding to a single electron moving from one energy level to another. You really should not think too literally about the Bohr model since it is not a correct view of how atoms actually work. It was a model that worked only for an isolated hydrogen atom (and not even perfectly for that). There's no way to apply it to argon or any other atom. This is what prompted physicists to keep working to find our modern model of the atom. What you can apply is the concept of quantized energy levels. Bohr's model was a first step in that direction.",Electron,How is the energy from a photon distributed among the electrons in various energy shells/sublevels/orbitals?
The RNA primer contain uracil but it is  removed and replaced by DNA by enzymes including a nuclease and a polymerase. There are no DNA primers in humans. ,RNA,How is the RNA changed into DNA?
"The direction that energy gets transformed in always happens according to the second law of thermodynamics. This states that energy changes only happen in ways in which that entropy increases (or stays the same), but not decrease. In a small area, entropy may decrease, but overall the entropy of the universe must increase. There are lots of way to describe entropy, but it is closely related to heat. So one example of the second law of thermodynamics is saying that heat can only flow from a hot object to a cold object. If you have a hot and a cold block of metal next to each other, you won't see the cold one get colder and the hot one get hotter. The thermal energy from the hot one will become more spread out and passed on also to the colder one, until they reach the same temperature. As for why this happens, I can't really explain _why_ energy only flows in this direction. But everything follows these patterns. There isn't anything that can break the second law of thermodynamics. ",Energy,It move all by itself without anything else applying force on the energy?
"These cells that are uncontrollably dividing are also not doing their normal jobs. They are diverting bodily resources and not performing vital functions. For example, if you have tumor in your heart those cancer cells in that tumor are not doing what normal heart cells do, work together to pump blood. The actual immediate cause of death varies. For example, someone might die of a blood clot in their brain from a tumor blocking a vital blood vessel.",Cancer,What about the cells dividing uncontrollably makes cancer so lethal?
"Division involves separating 2 bundles of chromosomes by pulling them by their centromeres. Condensation allows for everything to untangle prior to division (remember that a single human cell has around 2 meters of DNA !), and it also gives more resistance to the chromosomes themselves so they do not break while being pulled back and forth during metaphase/anaphase.",Chromosome,Why cant chromosomes undergo division without condensing?
"A nucleophile is a Lewis base (an electron pair donor). Let's represent it as Nu:-. An electrophile is a Lewis acid (an electron pair acceptor). Let's represent it as E+. Now, let's compare chloride ion, Cl-, and a chlorine molecule, Cl2. Cl- is a pretty good *nucleophile*, because it has four lone pairs and a negative charge. It can react with some electrophile, E+ Cl:- + E+ → Cl-E Now let's look at Cl2 as a nucleophile. It has six lone pairs, so it should be a good nucleophile, right? *Wrong*. Cl2 acting as a nucleophile with E+ would give: Cl-Cl: + E+ → Cl+ + Cl-E The reaction would form Cl+, but this won't happen because Cl is the second most electronegative atom in the Periodic Table. It won't easily give up its electrons to form a positive ion. Rather, Cl2 will act as an *electrophile* in a reaction like Nu:- + Cl-Cl → Nu-Cl + :Cl- This generates a nice, stable chloride ion, so everybody is happy. Summary, chloride ion is a nucleophile but chlorine is an electrophile.",Chlorine,Something about chlorine not being stable?
"Are all motor proteins found in living creatures? The answer is yes because motor proteins are found in living cells and function them properly. they have varied specific and important roles and they are found in all living cells doing all the things inside the cells. motor proteins are essential proteins for all organisms - they have lots of important roles such as muscle contraction, transporting cargo around the cell and cell motility",Motor protein,Do motor proteins all serve a similar function or can they have many varied or specific roles?
"There are different types of neurones in the body, with different locations of the axons and dendrites. The neurone that you are most familiar with are *multipolar* neurones. They make up 99% of all neurones and has 3 or more processes projecting out of the soma. They are the classic example of neurones, with axons carrying information away from the soma and dendrites bringing information back in. The other two types are *bipolar* and *unipolar* neurone. Bipolar neurones has only two processes: an axon and a dendrite. They are found in special sensory places, such as the retina of the eye or the olfactory epithelium. Unipolar neurones have only 1 processes, which contains both the axon and dendrite. They are more common, found in the skin, joints, muscles, and internal organs.",Dendrite,Why the sensory neurons in the ganglia have axons that carry impulses towards the soma instead of dendrites that carry impulses towards the soma?
"Whenever you swallow something, the muscle contractions pull up on the hyoid bone, which draws the larynx up and tips the epiglottis backwards to cover the opening of the trachea. You can feel part of this process happen if you lightly press on the top of your thyroid cartilage. When you breathe you don't need to swallow the air, so the muscles don't contract and the trachea stays open. All the force driving the air comes from a partial vacuum in the lungs, so it travels through the lower pressure of the trachea rather than the oesophagus.",Trachea,How does the body know what to send down the esophagus and what to send down the trachea?
"Carbon 12 is stable and is very common, so any lab can get it easily. You would want an element that has an equal number of neutrons and protons. C12 is one of many that fit that requirement. Before they used carbon, they used to use oxygen, until the 1960's",Carbon-12,Is there any specific reason mole was defined using the number of elemental entities of carbon-12?
"since tRNA has very long half-life compared to mRNA it is present near ribosome until the end of translation but cannot re-join A site since it does not carry amino acid anymore and there is no hydrolysis of GTO an Ef-Tu factor to bind to help translation. After the translation is over, tRNAs disassemble and after quite a while degrade.",Transfer RNA,Where does the tRNA go?
"gas giants aren't failed stars, that is a common but false myth. Here is the reason the gas giants are gas giants: there used to be gas throughout the solar system, when it was a nebula. As planets grew in size, they collected gas in the form of atmospheres. However, as the SUN grew, most of the gas was blown away by the subsequent solar wind and radiation. The closer you get, the stronger it is. That's why Mercury has practically no atmosphere, and the gas giants are so large. In addition, most gas giants have solid rocky cores on the inside, and those are, in fact, larger than Earth. This means they have a greater gravitational field, counteracting the solar wind. In short: a combination of large cores and distance from the Sun allowed Gas Giants to stay gassy, while rocky planets like mercury, Mars, Venus, or earth lost most or all of that gas to solar wind.",Gas giant,Did gas giants and sun form in different ways?
"sulfur does not follow the octet rule. In Sulfur dichloride , the octet rule is obeyed. only elements in the second period follow the octet rule, and there are exceptions. C, N, O, and F always follow the octet rule, while B, Mg, and Na can deviate. boron can have 6 sometimes.",Octet rule,Why does Sulfur not follow the octet rule?
"You wouldn't know for sure, but there are a couple of factors to consider. The carbons on the end (i.e. the CH3 groups) have more H's than the middle CH2 group(s), so statistically there is a higher chance of one of these H's reacting just based on numbers. Also, the CH3 groups are more accessible, so we might expect that these would react more quickly and thus dominate in kinetically controlled reactions. In terms of thermodynamics, radicals are missing an electron (compared to a full octet) so are electron poor. Thus, their order of stability mirrors that of carbocations: more highly substituted carbon radicals are more stable than primary carbon radicals.",Radical (chemistry),How would you know which proton the chlorine radical would take?
"the soil, the atmosphere has salt. Hydro-logical cycle is no difference. It is all harmonised and synchronised so water actually picks up salt form soil as well as atmospheric waters pick up salt nuclei from the atmosphere and bring down to the ocean.",Salt,How is salt in the water?
"oxygen, nitrogen and fluorine only bind in the same way in that they form covalent bonds. Otherwise, they are completely different. To name a few: each of them form different number of bonds. Cl bonded with hydrogen is an acid, while N bonded with hydrogen is basic. Also, note that nitrogen is only more abundant in the air we breathe. Oxygen is by far the most common element on earth (47% of earth mass)",Nitrogen,Why is there so much more water on Earth than ammonia even though nitrogen is more abundant?
"Typically new cells are generated as they are needed - i.e. cells are not being killed to make room for new cells - instead cells are being made to replace cells that die for other reasons. Cells can be irreparably damaged by injury and disease, they also can wear out due to their highly demanding environment - e.g. the stomach lining, which regularly experiences extremely acidic pH (as low as 1.5) - or are unable to maintain themselves like mammalian red blood cells$. These cells must be regularly replaced for an organism to continue to live. In fact, there is some evidence that failure to remove senescent (old and relatively inactive) cells contributes to aging! $These cells lack nuclei and so can't repair themselves.",Cell (biology),What is the point of continually producing new cells?
"Usually, a carbon needs four different substituents to be a chiral center. It is more sophisticated and accurate to think that carbons must be sp3 hybridized to four different substituents in order to be a chiral center. Allenes are an exception, but since they are so rare you probably do not need to worry about them. In regard to carbanions: Remember that a lone pair of electrons counts as a substituent, so carbanions with three different atomic substituents are chiral centers. Conversely, carbocations are not chiral centers because a plane of symmetry exists down each of its three bonds: The same is true of the three bonds of carbons with a double bond. So, a carbon with only three groups attached to it--but all three groups are different--is not a chiral center, but a 'pro-chiral' center.",Carbon,Is the carbon a chiral carbon or something else?
"Humans probably can make up for some the biodiversity that we lose is synthetics ways and stuff like that, but that doesn't take care of the all of the problems. For one thing, plants do a very good job performing photosynthesis. I don't think humans have ever found away to convert energy into food. Even if we have or possibly can it's probably not as efficient as a plant's photosynthesis and it would hard to reproduce that process on a scale large enough to feed millions of people. Also, plants are at the bottom of the food chains and if we lose plants we lose all other kind of living organisms. Another effect losing biodiversity has is on the climate and cycles of water, carbon, nitrogen etc. Our climate gets messed up when the ecosystem is messed up (and our ecosystem gets messed up when the climate gets messed up...). Also,the problem with losing some biodiversity and trying to get along with only some other species is they are all inter-related in very complicated ways, and I don't think we fully understand them all. We have a intricate balance and if that gets messed up we might have more problems than we can predict. However, as we do lose biodiversity, we might have to do more with creative solution that don't make us depend on other species. But that isn't the best solution and preserving the environment, in the end, the most productive and cost-effective solution.",Species,Do humans need to protect other species or can we do without?
"glucose is a sugar that we consume in our diet, we store it in our body as glycogen... why do we store it? 2 main reasons; 1.) so that we do not become hyperactive and have too much energy used all at once or 2.) so our blood glucose levels will become normal because too much glucose in the blood leads to a serious case of hyperglycemia aka diabetes. Glycogen helps us get energy when we need it by storing excess glucose from our diet",Glucose,How does breaking up the polysacchride glucose molecule help us transfer it into energy?
Mutation rates are not reliant on sexual reproduction. Mutation is an error in copying. This can occur in sexual or asexual reproduction. Bacteria are also known to swap DNA. In fact there is a lot of unusual transfer of genetic material occurring in bacteria,Bacteria,How are  bacterias any mutations in bacteria then?
"Protease activates the reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease in the immature viruses so they can continue the replication cycle.",Virus,Does the virus becomes mature and can infect other nearby cells?
"Natural selection favors traits that are better for the ORGANISM'S survival and reproduction not for the environment. So actually the inverse would be true. A human who has a gene (not conscious choice, as genes - not thought - are passed onto offspring) that makes him susceptible to having more children will pass on that gene (as it is likely that more of his children will survive than someone who has, say 1 child) to more offspring and will thus be selected for.",Natural selection,If natural selection is favouring traits which are beneficial for the environment?
Sugar is made up of molecules that have polar areas. The polar ends of the water molecule attract the positivately charged polar areas of the sugar molecule. Polar hydroxyl groups of the sugar molecule are solvated by water molecules.,Molecule,"Do the molecules fully break down into Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen?"
There's no hard and fast rule that the definition of ecosystem has to necessarily contain the word 'abiotic factors'; only the word 'environment' is enough. For example: There are bacteria in the gut which help in breaking down food. And there are no abiotic 'factors' present in the gut. Here the gut is the bacteria's environment. So it's absolutely ok if we have an ecosystem without an abiotic factor.,Ecosystem,Could a ecosystem just have biotic factors but not abiotic factors?
This type of virus depends on components in the envelope (e.g. glycoproteins) to interact with and infect new cells. The envelope looks like the outside of a host cell and so they would probably be easier for the immune system to recognize and destroy. The envelope may also protect the rest of the virus from non-immune destruction (e.g. attack by proteases).,Virus,Would viruses still be infectious?
"Secondary consumers could be omnivores. They may be primary consumers in one food chain by eating the producers. A mouse may eat a grasshopper (secondary consumer), or it may eat seeds (primary consumer).",Trophic level,Is organism always going to occupy the secondary consumer trophic level in other food chains?
"How heavy something is depends on its mass and how strong gravity is (e.g. you weigh less on the moon than on the earth, but you mass hasn't changed). Mass and weight are, however, directly proportional (that is, both can tell you about how heavy an object is). Since mass is a constant property of an object, and not dependent on any outside forces, it can be used in kinematic formulas universally and is thus much more practical and useful than weight.",Mass,Why is mass the one that changes force?
"Even if the shorter bp of DNA migrates farther than it is supposed to, the other channels of DNA strands will also have DNA fragments going farther, so it can still be used as a reference. There is not a standard time, but naturally, one should be careful not to let it run too long, so all of the DNA does not go to one end of the gel.",Standard time,Is there a standard time for running of gel?
"Our enzymes can't properly break down some certain glucose molecules like cellulose. This is why eating celery requires a lot of energy, when we eat celery more energy goes into breaking it down into glucose than into storing energy from the food source.",Energy,"In an emergency case, can we eat them to get energy?"
"the charge is a natural property of protons and electrons. It does not appear to come from anywhere, it just exists. An electrical charge can be defined as the natural property of certain kinds of matter that cause their paths of motion to be deflected when exposed to a magnetic field. When electrical charges were first discovered, one of type of charge was arbitrarily called ""negative"" and the other type was arbitrarily called positive. Since the two types of charge tend to cancel each other out, picking one to call negative and the other to call positive is a reasonable convention.",Proton,What gives an electron a negative charge and what gives a proton a positive charge?
An isolated charge creates an electric field in the free space surrounding the charge. There isn't a force in free space because there is no other particle in the vicinity. Force only exists if there is a physical body present to experience it.,Force,Does that mean a  force exists in an isolated charge?
"It happens due to hydrolysis. The alpha subunit releases GDP, takes in GTP then leaves the beta and gamma subunits. the ligand binding to the receptor changes the conformation of the G Protein which makes it have a lower affinity of binding to GDP and increases the affinity for GTP which is why it drops the GDP and picks up the GTP.",Guanosine triphosphate,Is it actually exchanged for GTP?
"Milk develops lactic acid that is produced by the bacteria Lactobascilus casei. This lactic acid is sour ,it has a lower pH.",PH,Does it have a lower pH?
"Maybe it has something to do with the different reactions, like that there's the P680 oxidant in the light-depended reaction but only the P700 in Calvin's cycle. So my answer would be that there isn't P680 in the part of the thylakoid where the Calvin's cycle occurs. EDIT: but I'm not sure since Sal showed in the video so that it all seemed to be happening in the thylakoid membrane... hmmm... EDIT 2. XD. Maybe the both reactions happen in the thylakoid but in different kinds of proteins so that the first one has P680 and the other one has P700.",P680,Why does the electron instead go to an intermediate protein at a higher energy level than it would have in P680?
"Most chiral molecules have chiral centers, but there are some exceptions. The best known are members of a class of compounds known as allenes, which have two double bonds in a row. So some compounds can have enantiomers without having a chiral center.",Chirality (chemistry),If a molecule is a enantiomer is it necessary that its a chiral molecule?
"Well the main type of cell that does not contain 46 chromosomes is our sperm or egg cells. These cells are only Haploid (n), meaning that they have half of the chromosomes that a regular somatic (body) cell has, which is know as Diploid (2n). The main reason it has half of the chromosomes is because the sperm cell of the father will have to merge with the egg cell of the mother and if both cells had 46 chromosomes then 46 + 46 would equal 92, twice as many chromosomes than we actually have! Therefore these gamete cells have only 23 chromosomes to allow for half the genes of the mother and half the genes of the father to merge and create a baby with the genes of both parents.",Chromosome,What are some specific cells that does not contain all 46 chromosomes?
"When you divide both sides by 20 mL, the units cancel out so it does not matter what you choose. All that matters is that the unit you choose is the same throughout the equation. Dividing 27.4mL by 20mL is the same as dividing 0.0274L by 0.02L. You will get the same number and there will be no units! So, we can say that mL were used simply because the information was given in mL and it would have been unecessary to change.",Litre,Shouldn't the unit of the volume be in litres (the same way that molarity uses litres)?
"It is possible to determine the probability that a single atomic nucleus will 'survive' during a given interval. This probability amounts to 50% for one half-life. In an interval twice as long (2 T) the nucleus survives only with a 25% probability (half of 50%), in an interval of three half-life periods (3 T) only with 12.5% (half of 25%), and so on. You can't, however, predict the time at which a given atomic nucleus will decay. For example, even if the probability of a decay within the next second is 99%, it is nevertheless possible (but improbable) that the nucleus will decay only after millions of years. It's like flipping a coin. If you flip 'heads' ten times in a row, what are the chances that the next flip will be 'heads'. You might say, 'I've flipped ten heads in a row. The next one is much more likely to come up 'tails'. Nevertheless, your chances of flipping heads are the same as before: 1 out of 2. Some nuclei are much luckier at flipping the coin than others. They keep flipping until they get 'tails'; then they decay.",Probability,Do the remaining original elements have an even more likely chance of decaying sooner than later?
ll bare protons absorb at the same frequency and field strength. Let's call them v0 and B0. But protons in molecules are shielded by the electrons around them. That means that a higher external field will be needed to achieve resonance. Protons that are less shielded will require a lower external/frequency. Protons that are more shielded will require a higher external/frequency. ,Magnetic field,"Why inspite of providing higher magnetic field in case of shielded proton, resonance occurs at lower frequency?"
"you cannot heat steam 'forever'. Like all molecules, when sufficiently hot it will decompose. There is not a set temperature at which it decomposes, it is more of a gradual process as the temperature increases. You start getting significant quantities of water decomposing at around 2500 K. At about 3000 K you get around 50% of water molecules decomposing. Of course, this is a rather hot temperature and it is rather impractical to generate, much less create a container to house the reaction.",Temperature,Is there a limit to that the steam will get hotter?
"One possible way geothermal energy can be used is, certain forms of algae and other aquatic microbes live associated with geothermal springs. These algae use a method called _chemosynthesis_ with geothermal energy used primarily as an energy source",Geothermal energy,What would geothermal energy be used for as an energy source?
"The molecules in the water have a range of kinetic energies, from low to high. Some of the molecules have sufficient kinetic energy to break out and to enter the air. In coastal areas there are also factors. For example, waves churn up the water and give rise to very fine droplets that can get carried in the wind.",Water,How does water evaporate?
"At the same time that vesicles pinch off of the ER, there are vesicles arriving at the ER, restoring its share of membrane. The net result is that it doesn't really change in size. Also cells can manufacture membrane phospholipids in the cytosol. This is important for cell growth so that eventually division is possible.",ER (TV series),Does the ER become smaller and smaller every time?
"Water passing in and out of membranes dilutes or concentrates the solute in or out of the membrane. So if there is a lot of solute inside the membrane and not much outside, the water will go into the membrane to dilute the higher concentration so that it becomes lower and reaches equilibrium.",Concentration,What about a higher concentration of water in the membrane would help the system reach equilibrium?
"Retinoblastoma (RB) prevents DNA replication. When retinoblastoma is phosyphorylated however, RB is inactivated and so DNA replication can proceed. so RB blocks synthesis, until cyclins are produced (cyclin E and cylcin D to be specific) when the cell has made the neecessary preparations.",Retinoblastoma,Is the cyclin's function to stop retinoblastoma from blocking the process?
The molarity you use to measure the equilibrium constant is the molarity at equilibrium.,Molar concentration,At what point are you supposed to use the molarity?
", chlorine is much smaller and has a higher affinity to the electrons it has. Even as an anion, it is less inclined to give up an electron due to its high affinity. The acid is only present at very low concentration compared to the monomer molecules, which make up essentially 100% of the reactants. The acid catalyst (better termed as a promoter here, because it never really regenerates) starts the reaction by protonating one of the monomers, forming the carbocation. From there, based on the population of the reaction mixture, the resulting carbocation is MUCH more likely to find another monomer's pi cloud. It is true that HCl will add across a double bond (a very standard addition reaction), but in that case both molecules (alkene plus HCl) are present in each quantity. Such is not the case here. A tiny amount of acid will trigger the linking of all of the monomers. ",Electron,Why is stealing an electron from a double bonded Carbon easier than stealing the electron from a Chloride anion?
"Ionic is a stronger bond. bond strength depends on multiple factors and you can't easily compare the strengths of ionic vs covalent bonds note: covalent vs.ionic is a continuum, the only completely covalent bonds are between identical atoms in identical contexts e.g.s `H-H`, `O=O`, 'H3C-CH3`. All other bonds range from covalent with very low polarity (usually described as 'non-polar covalent bonds') to extremely high polarity (aka. 'ionic bonds'). ",Covalent bond,Which bond is stronger ionic or covalent?
"Water is able to go through the cellular membrane hydrophobic tails,it takes them a lot of time since the hydrophobic tails attempt to repel the water. However, after a given amount go time the water is able to get through. Through passive transport it takes less time for the water to get to the other side of the cell membrane.",Cell membrane,How can water diffuse through the cellular membrane?
"boiling point will change, that has a lot to do with atmospheric pressure, and that is why in some places it takes a higher heat to boil or in others a lower heat to boil. Also about that topic it can take a longer time to boil or shorter based on atmospheric pressure, but that has more to do with pressure than heat.",Boiling point,How will the boiling point change?
"Having 2 strands is essential in the DNA replication process, where both strands act as a template in creating a copy of the DNA and repairing damage to the DNA. Additionally the process of transcription is directional with the coding strand acting as the template strand for genes that are being transcribed the other way.",Coding strand,What is the benefit of the coding strand?
"1. Hydrolysis is a term for both: electro-chemical process and biological one. When you separate water molecule via electric current is electrochemical, and condensation reaction explained here is biological. 2. Our bodies use amylase because the reverse process is not spontaneous and favored. Glycosidic bonds are stable and making inaccessible for a water molecule to break them.",Amylase,Why do our bodies use amylase?
"The electromagnetic force is considered a fundamental force. Fundamental meaning that there is no other known underlying mechanism behind it. So the electric field is just that, the electric field. Quantum mechanically the electric field is explained through the exchange of virtual photons between charges, but then photons themselves are explained as localized excitations of the electromagnetic field.",Electric field,What is the electric field made out of?
"shortwave radiation is higher energy than long wave radiation. If it were possible, in order to make a long wave short again, we would need somehow give that radiation back some energy. Generating energy usually requires burning fossil fuels, which produce CO2, which only accelerates the process of global warming.

"It is not actually *everything* that gets eaten, although a lot is eaten 'before it can go into the ground.' The formation of fossils is uncommon, but does happen. One important element determining whether or not fossilization happens is if the living organism died in or near water.",Fossil,How would we get fossils?
"The nucleophile is not reacting with the solvent. It is being surrounded by a shell of solvent molecules. The F- ion is small, so it has a high charge density, and the water molecules are held tightly to it. The I- ion is large, so it has a low charge density, and the water molecules are held loosely to it. A nucleophile has to push the solvent molecules out of the way in order to attack the substrate, so F- is a poorer nucleophile in a polar protic solvent. ",Protic solvent,Why is I- a better nucleophile in a polar protic solvent?
Most strong acids readily donate a proton to even weak bases like water. Do not just think of electronegativity. Any acid stronger than water will create hydronium. This is the leveling effect of water.,Hydronium,Why would oxygen will give its electron to hydrogen in the formation of H3O+?
"Size of an animal cell ranges from 10 to 30 micrometres while for plant cell it ranges from 10 to 100 micrometers. 1 micrometer is 1/1000 of a millimetre. And non-living things do not have a cell. They are not living and thus don't need any of our body systems. They just need a structure, no body systems, thus no cells. So non living things don't need cells.",Cell (biology),Do non living things have cell?
"presently all cells come from other cells - this means that any existing cell got the ribosomes it begins with from a progenitor cell, so any protein (including new ribosomal proteins) will initially be made by a ribosome that came from a progenitor cell. Enzymes can also be made from RNA and RNA is actually still used to catalyze some critical cellular processes such as translation. These observations led to the hypothesis that there was an ""RNA world"" in which RNA served to both store information (like DNA does now) and to catalyze reactions (as is now usually done by proteins).",Ribosome,Does Ribosome exists first or Protein does?
"A membrane bound nucleus is basically the control center of a eukaryotic cell. It houses the genetic information (DNA and RNA). It is called membrane boundbecause the nucleus is surrounded by membranes. These membranes are in the nuclear envelope, which lets RNA as well as other things go outside the nucleus and into the cell. Prokaryotic cells can survive without membrane bound nuclei because their genetic information is in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is the part of the cell outside the nucleus.",Cell nucleus,How can prokaryotes survive without the membrane bound nucleus?
"The half-life is a statistical probability. Without getting too much into the math, you can think of the half-life as being the time it takes for there to be a 50% chance that any given particle will decay. But, just understand that there is no 'due date'. If the particle has not decayed after one half life, it is no more likely to decay in the next half life than in the first. In this sense, there is no 'history' of how long the particle has waited around to decay -- the chances of it decaying never change. There will always be a 50% chance that it will decay during any time span equaling its half-life. This is just as true for the first half-life as it is for the 70th half-life. If you have a statistically large number of such particles (say, a few million) there is almost certainly going to be half of them that decay every half-life. It won't be exactly half, but it will be very close to it.",Half-life,How to find out the half-life?
"A ligament can be injured, usually by being over-stretched during a sudden pull. The ligaments at the side of the ankle are the ones most commonly sprained. A damaged ankle ligament causes inflammation, swelling, and bleeding (which shows as bruising) around the affected joint. Moving of the joint is painful.",Ligament,How is a ligament tear different from a sprain and why does it require surgery?
The formal definition of voltage is based on two positive charges near each other. One charge is in a fixed location and a second test charge is moved toward and away from the other. The farther away the test charge gets the lower its potential and the lower its voltage. Power generated by the electric utility is not using this simple setup. People don't collect a big pile of electrons as the fixed charge and repel some free electrons into the transmission lines. The voltage would drop if people lived farther away from the power station.,Voltage,Will the voltage not decrease from the increase of distance from the power generation site to people's house (according to the formula)?

"Using concentrations in the Nernst equation is a simplification. In reality, what we care about is the activity. For solutions, the activity is equal to the concentration, which is why we can get away with just writing concentrations for these species. Pure solids and liquids have an activity of 1, so we can ignore them (since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value).",Solid,Why do leave lot concentration of pure solids?
"While it is very long, the DNA in our cells is also incredibly thin (~2 nm) and so it can be 'folded' into a relatively small space. The genetic material in eukaryotes is known as chromatin. Chromatin is composed of DNA plus associated proteins and RNAs. These other molecules organize, fold, protect, and control the DNA. The DNA in chromatin is wound around protein complexes called nucleosomes and then further twisted and looped into higher order structures. There are a large number of proteins involved in this packaging (and also in the unpackaging that has to happen for replication and transcription to occur). As a result of all this packaging, the ~2 m of DNA in a typical human cell fits inside the ~6 µm diameter nucleus! ",DNA,How does the DNA fit in a human body?
"Interestingly enough, so-called idiot savants, do not have a greater capacity for computation, music, or art. Instead, the parts of their brains responsible for such tasks dominate the rest of their brain because the parts that would normally compete for attention are either damaged or unable to communicate effectively with the rest of the brain. Researchers have used something called TMS (trans-cranial magnetic stimulation) to induce small currents in parts of the brain, either shutting down or activating specific regions of the brain temporarily. Their research has shown that it is possible to temporarily induce a savant-like state in normally functioning brains. And, of course, some forms of brain damage can induce temporary or permanent savant-like states as well.",Intelligence,Does human beings have the capacity to use all areas of cerebral cortex or only few designated areas?
"There is no difference between acting as an enzyme and being an enzyme. Ribosomes are a complexes that contain multiple proteins (~60 in prokaryotes, ~80 in eukaryotes) and several RNAs.

"Water's high specific heat _is_ do to its hydrogen bonds. Water coheres to itself because of the slightly positive and slightly negative charges of the hydrogen and oxygen, respectively. To break these bonds (there are more than one could possibly count just in a drop of water), it takes a lot of energy. This is why an iron pot heats up so much while the water inside is only slightly warm (because the iron has a lower specific heat than water!).",Hydrogen bond,"Does water have a high specific heat due to it's hydrogen bonds, or does something get the credit for that?"
"Chemical signaling present in the cell and between cells helps the movement of proteins. Vesicles always know where to go, and where they will be uptaken.

After binding, changes occur.",Protein,How does the protein know where to go?
"Electronegativity is how strongly the element hogs the election ONCE the covalent bond is made. Electropotential is the tendancy of the element to lose/gain electrons (so I see it close to ionization energy/electron affinity definitions). Nevertheless, they are related.",Electronegativity,Do electronegativity and elektrodepotential both describe to what extent an atom can attract electrons?
"During DNA Replication and Repair there are MUTATIONS/ERRORS in coding, and it is of several types: (1) the substitution of one base pair for another, (2) the deletion of one or more base pairs, and (3) the insertion of one or more base pairs. Among them, (1)The substitution of one base pair for another is a common type of mutation. But in contrast after DNA Replication even if there is an error, DNA polymerase II comes into action and replaces it with the correct base pair. So, there is a very very very less chance of Mutation. Mostly, Mutation occurs by Sex-linked Inheritance.",Mutation,How do mutations happen?
"The two strands don't encode the same information - they have different sequences! Within a gene *usually* only one strand is transcribed, but there are many examples where transcription happens from the both strands. This is especially common in viruses.

"When half the pixels are black and half are white, this is the highest entropy. The reason for this is that, if you consider every different possible arrangement of pixels that would give 50% black and 50% white, there are more possibilities for this 50/50 split than for any other percentage split. This makes the 50/50 split the most probable, and thus it has the highest entropy. some of these possibilities might look 'organized', for example a bunch of black pixels grouped together (though this arrangement is improbable). This would be one of many microstates (i.e. individual possible arrangements of pixels) that contributes to the maximum entropy macrostate (i.e. the big picture that there is a 50/50 split between black and white pixels). If you limited yourself to only having a bunch of black pixels grouped together, however, then the entropy would be lower, since the probability of this happening is lower once you introduce a restriction. In the pixel system, low entropy would be if all of the pixels were black or all of the pixels were white.",Entropy,What would low entropy look like in such a system?

"There is an attraction between the electrons and the protons of the bonds. It requires energy to overcome this attraction, and hence energy needs to be absorbed into the reaction to break those bonds. It's not the breaking of the bond that releases energy, per se. While the bond between ADP and Pi is broken, stronger bonds are formed during hydrolysis. These bonds account for the release of energy that occurs when ATP is split into ADP and Pi",Adenosine diphosphate,"Why making ATP from ADP requires energy, but here making a bond releases energy?"
"It is possible to determine the probability that a single atomic nucleus will 'survive' during a given interval. This probability amounts to 50% for one half-life. In an interval twice as long (2 T) the nucleus survives only with a 25% probability (half of 50%), in an interval of three half-life periods (3 T) only with 12.5% (half of 25%), and so on. You can't, however, predict the time at which a given atomic nucleus will decay. For example, even if the probability of a decay within the next second is 99%, it is nevertheless possible (but improbable) that the nucleus will decay only after millions of years. It's like flipping a coin. If you flip 'heads' ten times in a row, what are the chances that the next flip will be 'heads'. You might say, 'I've flipped ten heads in a row. The next one is much more likely to come up 'tails'. Nevertheless, your chances of flipping heads are the same as before: 1 out of 2. Some nuclei are much luckier at flipping the coin than others. They keep flipping until they get 'tails'; then they decay.",Half-life,Why do we press the figurative 'reset' button once the half-life number of years has been achieved?
"DNA sequencing is better evidence for Universal Common Descent (UCD) than fossil evidence. This is mostly because intermediate fossils do not necessarily have to be ancestral, they just have to mix and match traits between the predicted relationships. DNA sequencing, on the other hand, automatically suggests a genealogical relationship, but it also confirms the prediction of relationships made by UCD in a more concrete way than fossil evidence.",Scientific method,Which would you say is the most significant supporting evidence for evolution via natural selection?
"In mitosis, the parent cell is diploid, which means that they will have 46 chromosomes (2n).

"In a neutral atom the number of electrons and protons are the same. In the case of sodium, it is 11p, 11e and 12n. Also an elcetron has 1 unit negative charge on it. hence when sodium will lose one electron it will lose 1 unit negative charge. therefore the cpnfiguration changes to 11p, 10e, 12n. the number of protons is greater than the number of electrons. hence, sodium ion is always referred to as Na+.",Sodium,Why is Na described as Na+ most of the time?

There are actually several different variations on binary fission including multiple fission where the cells split into more than two daughters. The mechanistic details - for example of how the replicated DNA is separated into the daughter cells also varies among different species.,Fission (biology),Does binary fission occur in the same way?
"Most eukaryotic cells only divide in the presence of _mitogens_. Mitogens stimulate cell division by increasing the amount of _G1 cyclins_, which trigger cells to enter _Start_ (i.e., the point in G1 which cells commit to divide). G1 cyclins regulate entry into _Start_ by turning on expression of G1/S and S cyclins. Thus, G1 cyclin concentrations are elevated during the phases that require G1/S and S cyclins. This explains why the levels of G1 cyclin span a large portion of the cyclin expression cycle. At what point in the cell cycle would cells no longer require mitogens for division? As mentioned above, at _start_, cyclin G1/S is activated by G1 cyclin and through a positive feedback loop, G1/S cyclin is able to maintain its own activity and G1 cyclin and mitogens are no longer needed to drive the cell cycle. This explains why the levels of G1 begin to plateau. Yet, G1 cyclin is still needed for S cyclin activation, so G1 cyclin concentrations does not rapidly fall after the activation of G1/S cyclin.",Cyclin,Why do G1 cyclin concentrations span the entirety of the cyclin expression cycle?
"Like the reason we are made up of many different cells versus one big cell. Absorption by little cells is much more efficient than large cells. So you have the two smaller lungs and they are divided into even smaller bronchioles and they are covered in villi to maximize surface area.

"entire chromosomes are very long (100s of millions of base pairs in humans) and can't be meaningfully compared using gel electrophoresis. The speed of DNA migration during gel electrophoresis mostly depends on the length of the DNA, not the sequence. This means a given piece of DNA from different species (or individuals) might or might not differ in their migration even though they have different sequences. Furthermore, two different alleles within a single organism often result in different lengths of DNA. To do identification of species often requires much more precision that you get with gel electrophoresis (and even more precision is needed to separate individuals within a species).",DNA,"Can forensic scientists get the suspect's DNA and the found DNA, and compare the speed they are travelling and determine if both of DNA belong to the same person?"

"The electronegativity of the chloride ion is much higher than that of the chlorine substituted alkene. It requires more energy to take electrons from a source with a higher electron affinity (higher EN value). a carbocation is more stable when it's a tertiary carbon than a secondary or then primary.

"Noble gases are elements that are at the last period of the periodic table. They are normally found as a gas at STP (273.15K or 0degree Celsius and 1 atm), which explains the gas part. Of course, noble gases can become solids and liquids at low temperatures. But not during normal conditions. For example, Mercury is the only liquid metal in the periodic table at normal conditions, however, other metals can melt and become liquids at higher temperatures. The noble part comes because the noble gases have full outer electron shells of eight electrons each. So they are satisfied with their electron configuration and do not want to share electrons with other elements including other noble gases. Which means that they are extremely nonreactive, hence the noble part of their name. So in short, noble gases are called so as they are extremely nonreactive and are gases at normal temperatures.",Gas,"Is it because they are naturally found as gases (if that's actually true), or is there some other reason?"
"The atoms in the mirror absorb the photons that come in and re-emit identical photons. In a way, this question is almost philosophical - how can we really tell the difference between absorbing and re-emitting an identical thing, versus if the thing just bounced off? The answer really just depends on the theory that we are using to describe what happened. In this case, quantum mechanics mathematics describing an absorption/re-emission mechanism match empirical results. And since that same theory has such wide application, we say that's what really happened. But classical physics can also describe the reflection in a way that equally matches empirical results, and classical physics says the light just bounced. If not for the fact that we know that quantum physics is more accurate across a wider range of reality than classical physics is, we could just as well say that the light bounced.",Light,Do mirrors absorb and re emit the light at the same wavelength or do they physically reflect the light?
"every species has a different number of chromosomes for its specific needs. Like a hedgehog has 108 chromosomes while we only have 46 (or 23 pairs). They all pair for specific needs.

"Given that the other reactant, ethoxide, is a much stronger nucleophile than chlorine would be in this compound, the reaction will favor the ethoxide as the nucleophile.

"Hypertonic solutions contain more solutes than isotonic solutions, which are basically 'neutral' solutions. So in order to even out the solutes (not the solvent), the solvent will move across the semipermeable membrane so that the solutes have more room to spread out. That's what osmosis is all about: spreading the solutes out by moving the solvent. If the water molecules from the hypertonic area flowed into the hypotonic area, it might maintain the balance of the solvent. However, the solutes would be even more concentrated in the hypertonic solution, and even less concentrated in the hypotonic solution, causing this situation to become something other than osmosis because the solutes were not evened out. The solvent was moved, but the solutes were more concentrated (hypertonic solution) or less concentrated (hypotonic solution); if this was really osmosis, the concentration of solutes should have been equal on both sides of the semipermeable membrane.",Tonicity,Shouldn't water molecules from the hypertonic area flow out to the hypotonic area in order to maintain the balance?

ADP stands for Adenosine diphosphate. ATP stands for Adenosine triphosphate. Loss of an inorganic phosphate (Pi) from ATP results in ADP. ADP is basically the energy released from the breaking of the molecular bond which is the energy humans use to keep humans alive,Adenosine diphosphate,Then what's ADP?
"Straight-chain alkanes are able to pack and layer each other better than their branched counterparts. This allows greater intermolecular forces, which raises the melting point since it will take more energy to disperse the molecules into a liquid. Similarly, even-numbered alkanes stack better than odd-numbered alkanes, and will therefore have higher melting points.",Melting point,Why are alkanes' melting points like this?
"You would have two half reactions; an oxidation half reaction and a reduction half reaction. Remember: oxidation is losing electrons, reduction is gaining electrons. So the half reaction that has some element or compound plus electrons on the REACTANTS side would be the reduction reaction. The half reaction with some element or compound plus electrons on the PRODUCTS side is the oxidation reaction.",Redox,How do you know which is oxidation and reduction?

"The stability of an atom is dependent on the nucleus itself, not on the electrons. Also, metals make such good conductors because they have a relatively weak grip on their valence electrons. Therefore, by providing a voltage, it is easy to take electrons from the outer shell and get them to flow.",Atom,Would not the atoms become unstable?
"The molecules can't get out of the way fast enough when you hit the water from a height without diving into it, so they exert a force that your body perceives as pain. It' not the surface tension as such, but the hydrogen bonds that hold the molecules together in the liquid.",Surface tension,Is surface tension responsible for the pain felt by a person?
"Secondary succession is when species recolonize the habitat. I do not think that during winter species are _wiped off_ the forest. they do change their behavior action and plant are hidden under the snow, but it does not mean they disappear. If you consider swallow migration to South and then returning to North in the spring, only in that case your definition can apply. Those are migrations and cyclic changes that happen every year regularly (under just one year span) so I am not sure whether we can call it secondary succession.",Secondary succession,Could any forest in the spring recovering from any winter be considered secondary succession?
"Since the p orbitals are perpendicular, it would be impossible to get all three in the necessary orientation at the same time to make three pi bonds. A maximum of two p orbitals can form pi bonds to the same atom.",Pi bond,Are there ever triple pi bonds?
"Intermolecular bonds break easier, but that does not mean first. Statistically, intermolecular bonds will break more often than covalent or ionic bonds. They can both break at the same time, it is just a matter of probability. Water, for example is always evaporating, even if not boiling. But, then, why no hydrogen or oxygen is observed as a product of pure water? Because water decomposes into H+ and OH- when the covalent bond breaks. The concentration of each of these ions in pure water, at 25 degree Celsius, and pressure of 1atm, is 1.0×10e−7mol/L... that is: covalent bonds are breaking all the time (self-ionization), just like intermolecular bonds (evaporation). By the way, that is what makes both pH and pOH of water equal 7. Note that even though H+ and OH- are naturally produced in water, they also recombine back into H2O. The speed of bonds breaking and the speed of recombination fight one another, until they are in chemical equilibrium, that is when both speeds are the same. For instance, this kind of fight also happens with evaporation inside a closed recipient. The equilibrium is reached when the number of molecules escaping from the liquid phase is the same as the number of molecules entering it.",Intermolecular force,Do intermolecular or intramolecular bonds break first?
"An atom may donate an electron and attain octet configuration or it may gain electron and attain octet configuration. It is also possible that the atom shares its electron(as in O2) and attain stability. The bond formed by donating or gaining electron is called ionic bond. The bond formed by sharing of electrons is called covalent bond Hope that helped. There are three types of bond. The nonpolar covalent bond is when the electrons are equally shared between the two atoms and don't have a preference. Then there is the polar covalent bond like in water, where the electrons are still shared between the two atoms but shows a preference to the more electronegative atom (oxygen), because oxygen simply has a stronger tendency to attract electrons than the hydrogen does. Finally, there is an ionic bond where the difference in electronegativity is so great that it is no longer sharing electrons. In the case of an ionic bond, chlorine steals an electron (or sodium loses an electron) because of the tendency to fill its valence shell to its full configuration for both atoms. All three bonds are equally possible for stability between the two atoms, but the ionic bond is the special bond that involves a complete transfer of electrons.",Electron,"Do the lose electrons, and form bonds because of their opposite charge?"
The bonds of the elements in fire have frequencies and the electrons in the atoms are changing orbital levels from high energy to lower energy levels while the matter is being oxidized thus creatinine a electro magnetic fields some of which (frequencies) are falling into the visual frequency range. The frequency range could be determined ed only if you knew what elements and how they are bonded.,Frequency,How to calculate the frequency of the fire?
"When you say same magnitude of velocity, that basically is speed. Instead of 180 degrees, if you turn 90 degrees and you continue at the same speed, same idea but easier to explain. Initially, before turning, you are going straight at 5 m/s for example. But then you suddenly turn right 90 degrees and continue at 5 m/s. Here speed has remained constant while velocity has changed. Velocity takes direction into account as well. So, after turning right, as we were initially taking forwards as the direction, velocity is 0. This is because you are not going forwards anymore, you turning left. This results in a change in velocity, hence causing acceleration. Here is an analogy which may help. You are in a 100m race, and the track is straight. Let's say you travel 50m in 5 seconds. That is 10m/s. But for some reason, you turn right and run at 10 m/s. But because you are going right, you are not surpassing 50m in the race. You are in the same place as someone standing still at the 50m mark. Therefore, your velocity is now 0m/s. The change from 10m/s to 0m/s is acceleration. (Deceleration to be more precise)",Acceleration,How does that give acceleration?
Straight-chain molecules have the ability to pack together more tightly which gives these molecules a higher melting point than other similar straight-chain molecules that are branched or have a kink (cis-double). The cis-double bond causes the molecule to not have the ability to stack or pack more tightly - causing a lower melting point.,Melting point,Why are alkanes' melting points like this?
"referring to the tight junctions between endothelial cells in the BBB, glucose and O2 get through because they are able to permeate through the endothelial cells. The cells have glucose transporters and co-transporters that use the driving force of sodium (and sometimes other ions) to help bring glucose into the cells",Glucose,How does the brain get the oxygen and glucose it needs?
"Every molecule can rotate. Some bonds can rotate, and some cannot. In a double bond between two atoms, the two atoms and the atoms that are _directly_ attached to them are rigidly fixed in the same plane. There is no rotation about the double bond. In a triple bond between two atoms, the two atoms and the atoms that are _directly_ attached to them are rigidly fixed in a straight line. The part of the moleculecannot cannot be bended out of its straight-line shape.",Molecule,In every case the molecule cannot rotate or flip?

"an air particle is not able to produce a compression of waves to generate a sonic boom. First of all, they change the direction many times per second... And like Matt B and Quantum Particle explained, an air particle is part of the medium itself. If it was a mental experiment, you could say that a tiny particle with a huge mass (and thus a huge density) can create a tiny sonic boom. But still there is the fact if some particle will be able to generate a compression... A compression is needed for the boom. Due to the size of the particle will it generate a compression or only hit in the particles? And what is the source of the sound? The particle will be able to disturb the air in such way that generates sound? even a particle with huge density will not be able to generate a sonic boom.",Sonic boom,Would air particles perform a tiny sonic boom?

"The chromatin structure in plants is fundamentally the same as that in animals, but modern clues have been found that may lead to the discovery of other-and perhaps quite significant-differences.",Chromatin,Does the chromatin of the cell have any significant change?
"the first stage would be the 'activation of amino acids'. Basically this step is before the initiation stage. During this activation of amino acids a specific amino acid and an ATP will bind to an enzyme called ""aminoacyl-tRNA synthesas"". The specific amino acid will bind the aminoacyl-tRNA synthesas where it will be activated by covalently binding with the ATP turning it into AMP during the process (releasing pyrophosphate). Then a tRNA will bind the aminoacyl-tRNA synthesas and it will covalently bind with the activated amino acid (releasing AMP). When the amino acid and the tRNA bind they will be released from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthesas and can then bind with the corresponding mRNA codon. So, when the tRNA leaves the E site is basically starts over the above process.",Transfer RNA,From where does tRNA get revived to continue its function in the future?

"One of the big unsolved problems in fundamental physics. in the very beginning of the universe - near what we call the Big Bang - the universe was extremely hot and extremely dense, too hot and dense for matter to exist. There was a _lot_ of energy around. But since space was also expanding very quickly, this energy was rapidly cooling down and spreading out. Eventually (after less than a few seconds) it became cold enough to condense into normal matter, in a process we have called _baryogenesis_. The problem is that our current best theories of particle physics predict that all processes that create matter must also create an equal amount of anti-matter, which would then annihilate each other leaving only light. Since we see a lot of matter all around us, this clearly is not the case. For some unknown reason, there was a lot more matter than anti-matter created in the beginning, when the universe was cooling down. Finding a better theory of particle physics which can tell us why this is is currently the job of many of the worlds physicists.",Matter,How did matter come to be in the first place?
"Entropy is not energy; entropy is how the energy in the universe is distributed. There is a constant amount of energy in the universe, but the way it is distributed is always changing. When the way the energy is distributed changes from a less probable distribution (e.g. one particle has all the energy in the universe and the rest have none!) to a more probable distribution (e.g. most particles have an amount of energy close to the average)",Entropy,Then how does the entropy of the universe increase over time?
"When you titrate HCl against Na2CO3, the reaction proceeds in two steps. The first step involves the production of NaHCO3 and this step has an equivalence point of about pH 8.3, in the range covered by phenolphthalein. Hence, the phenolphthalein changes colour at this first equivalence point. As more acid is dripped in, the NaHCO3 reacts to liberate CO2. The equivalence point for this second step is pH 3.7. However, the phenolphthalein has already changed colour so you will not detect this second equivalence point when using phenolphthalein. The way around this is to use a different indicator, such as methyl orange, that doesn't change colour until the second equivalence point is reached, at which point the reaction has gone to completion.",Titration,Why doesn't a titration of HCL against Na2CO3 go to completion?

"strong acid and bases giving 100% ionization in water has to do with equilibrium and reversible reactions. When an acid or base dissociates (or ionizes) in water, there's always the possibility of the reverse reaction, were the ions react to reform the not-dissociated acid or base. The amount an acid or base dissociates in water has to do with how much more one of these reactions is favored the forward reaction (the dissociation into ions), or the backward reaction (the ions reacting to form the original acid or base). Strong acids and bases almost overwhelmingly favor the forward reaction, because the resulting ions are relatively unreactive in aqueous solution.",Acid strength,Why do strong acid and bases give 100% ionization?

"A dipole is like a temporary polarity of a non polar molecule, but only last for nano seconds (hence why it can be called a dipole moment). It can happen because e-'s positions are represented by probability functions around the nucleus; at any given time, there can be more e- around one of the bonding atoms that the other because that's just the way it worked out.

"At physiological pH, amino acids are in a zwitterionic form, which means that the carboxylic group has lost its proton and is negatively charged, and the amino group has gained a proton and is positively charged. At lower pH, the carboxylic acid regains its proton, and at higher pH the amino group loses its excess proton. Amino acids are mainly found joined together in polymers called peptides and proteins. The amino group of one amino acid reacts with the carboxylic acid group of another, with the elimination of water. When that happens, then the properties of the polymerised amino acids depends on the nature of their side chains, which can be non-polar, basic or acidic.

"Osmosis is the movement of water via a semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution to a more concentrated solution.

electrons fill up orbitals in the increasing order of energy. all three p orbitals are of the same energy so the second electron will rather go in the second orbital and have the same spin as the first one than go in the orbital where the first one is and have repulsing inverse spin. s orbital has smaller energy than p orbitals so it is more stable for electrons to have inverse spins in that lower energy state than for one electron to go into higher energy state,Atomic orbital,Does this only work for p orbitals and beyond?

"BH3 is violently reactive on its own, so THF is used to stabilize the molecule. The BH3 essentially accepts an electron pair from the THF to complete its octet and form a stable BH3-THF complex. Think of THF as a calming agent. As far as the others are concerned: NaOH serves to remove a proton from H2O2, making it HO2, a better nucleophile (conjugate bases are always stronger nucleophiles). HO2 then attacks the boron to complete the rearrangement reaction, and the O is ultimately protonated with H2O to form a neutral alcohol. Keto-enol tautomerism kicks in here and the (C=O) bond is highly favored.",Tetrahydrofuran,What is the purpose of THF and hydrogen peroxide in this reaction?

"That's a good question and I don't think there is a clear cut answer. As you recognise, there are degrees of solubility and many substances are essentially insoluble yet still have a little bit of solubility. In fact, if a reaction is taking place in water, then that is because some ions have come away from the solid to engage in the reaction. But to answer your question, I think most of the time you would say that the substance was a solid if it was practically insoluble or only slightly soluble in water. Also, if a product precipitates out from a reaction then that would always be given a state symbol of solid. In some ways, it becomes clearer in ionic equations such as: AgCl (s) <---> Ag^+ (aq) + Cl^- (aq) This recognises that some of the silver chloride has dissolved, despite silver chloride being insoluble (the equilibrium will be well over to the left in this equation). Ions are always given the aqueous state symbol.

"Photons are, by nature, massless. That is why they are able to travel at the speed of light (C) and not just below it. Anything with mass cannot move at the speed of light. @kokocipher In answer to your question where does gravity ultimately come from, according to the General Theory of Relativity, the most widely accepted and most accurate theory used to explain our observations of gravity, gravity is the result of objects with mass bending space time. All objects bend spacetime, and more massive/dense objects bend it more steeply. That is they have a stronger gravitational pull. Since mass == energy (E=MC2)energy will indeed bend space time, if there is enough energy in a small enough space. However, consider the following. It requires the mass of an entire moon or planet to have an effect strong enough for you to feel. Since E=MC2 the amount of energy required to bend space the same amount (that is to have a gravitational influence that humans could detect without instruments) is unfathomable. If there's energy that dense it tends to collapse into matter. Indeed, this is what happens in our particle accelerators such as the LHC. As for black holes, they are locations in space where there is mass dense enough to bend spacetime so steeply that it would require movement faster than the speed of light to escape. Due to the nature of our Universe it is impossible to exceed the speed of light (I'm aware that sounds vague, but it would take a good hour to explain in more detail). Therefore, nothing, not even light, can escape.",Gravity,Do masses naturally have gravitational forces associated with them?

The way I'm understanding this is, with unbranched alkanes, when you're talking about breaking them completely apart (as opposed to just boiling them), are less stable - they release more energy when they are broken apart (higher heat of combustion).",Energy,"If less energy is needed to combust an isomer, wouldn't that mean it is less stable?"

"There are some enzymes, which work in many pathways. They have relatively poor substrate specificity and this is important, because it's function requires it to do transform so many chemically different substrates into metabolites. Eg: The cytochrome p450 in liver, alcohol dehydrogenase. The former is a very important enzyme system, which plays a role in metabolising (a fancy term for acting upon) a wide variety of foreign substances, which include drugs and toxins. These reactions are the main mechanism of our body to fight drugs, and competitive inhibition is important here when we want to design drug therapies, because if we give two drugs both of which are acted upon by this enzyme, then they shall compete for its binding, and a result both will be metabolised slowly (in relation to if each was given independently). Alcohol dehydrogenase metabolises alcohols, and hence is the reason why methanol is poisonous. IT converts it into the more poisonous methanoic acid. For a patient of methanol poisoning, the main therapy includes giving ethanol, so that it acts as a competitive inhibitor, preventing methanol from forming the harmful metabolite. The more substrate-specific enzymes, do not usually have complications pertaining to competitive inhibitors.",Substrate (chemistry),Would be there to compete with the substrate or only limited amount of reactions suffer through this phenomenon?
"paleontologists look first to see whether the fossil in questions has any teeth. this is a big help in determining the foods a dinosaur ate. In general, a meat-eating dinosaur will have long, serrated teeth like steak knives, or small but sharper teeth. Basically, the canines and other teeth used for cutting are more prominent. In omnivores, the canines and back teeth (molars) will both show wear, as both are being used. Plant-eaters would have less canines and more molars; several hadrosaurs had hundreds of molars in the backs of their mouths, to better grind of the tons of plant matter they ate every day (I think most of a brachiosaur's life was spent eating). If there are no teeth available, I believe paleontologists look for other signs, like rocks in the stomach, usually found in plant-eaters (these stones help to grind up plant material) , or other things in the stomach, like that dinosaur's last meal. Claws, teeth, girth size, and other such characteristics can help determine whether a dinosaur was a carnivore/herbivore.",Omnivore,How to know a dinosaur is carnivorous or omnivorous?
"Equilibrium must occur in a closed system (with a reversible reaction), you cannot have equilibrium in an open system, as small particles, especially gasses, can easily escape. In an open system, vaporisation does occur if the heat is at the concerned element's boiling point, as it turns into a gas and escapes, so vaporisation is one of the reasons why the equilibrium must occur in a closed system",Open system (systems theory),Does vaporization occur in an open system?
"What position humans really hold in the food chain is a topic that has recently come under debate. we don't really have natural predators, and we can easily hunt and eat even the largest of animals. However, studies concerning the trophic level of humans have shown that humans are similar to pigs and anchovies when it comes to overall diet, and are nowhere near the meat-only diets of the apex predators (this rank may change in the near future, as veganism and vegetarianism are gaining popularity). As for trophic levels, because of the fact that humans are omnivorous, they do not fall under a set, 'clear' trophic level. They can fall under level 2 (a human eats seaweed), level 3 (a human eats a lobster), or level 4 (a human eats an octopus). This can also happen if a human eats an omnivorous animal, who also does not have a set trophic level (a human eats bear meat).",Trophic level,Is it necessary that they have to occupy the topmost trophic level?

"thinking of the Golgi bodies as the post office of the cell. Before anything goes out, the golgi body sort of packages it with materials which will be easily given access to move through the cell membrane. This process is called glycolysation.

"the nucleotide sequences will be different. However, since we're normally considering genes within the same species it's normally quite easy to determine that two genes are 'the same' (by which we mean the genes were the same in a common ancestor, but one or both have mutated since then). Often the gene will be thousands of nucleotides long, so a few base pair differences means they are still 99% identical. It could be that one gene has a large deletion or insertion, but it's still possible to find identical regions. There are various alignment tools that give you a measure of how similar two sequences are. It's possible that two alleles could have completely different sequences, but you can still see that they are the 'same' gene based on the function of the protein they encode or by their position on the genome. But remember that allele is just a human invention to make it easy to compare different genomes. It just refers to the different sequences that an organism can inherit. It could be that one allele is a single copy of a gene whereas another allele is having three copies of the gene, or no copies of that gene. As with a lot of biology there are no hard and fast rules and definitions get blurry at the edges.",Gene,What makes the two different alleles the same gene?
"The air is forced in and out of our lungs via the diaphragm. The diaphragm is an involuntary muscle but can be controlled. Lungs are controlled by involuntary muscles, but can also be controlled via voluntary muscles. So under 'normal' conditions they are controlled via the involuntary muscles, i.e subconscious/with-out thinking, and voluntary when we try to control the rate we are breathing, so we use our abdomen muscles to 'mold' the lungs into a smaller shape, thus slowing down the breathing rate, or holding your breath while swimming, etc. As to your second question, either way you are still getting air in, however by breathing via your 'stomach' it allows for more air to be breathed in, compared to breathing via your 'chest', thus allowing for more gas exchange, due to the increase in surface area : volume ratio, other than that, I don't believe there is anything 'better'. Apparently it also allows you to 'sing' and speak better, and for longer bursts before having to breath again",Lung,Are lungs controlled in a voluntary or involuntary manner?

"It is indeed POSSIBLE for matter to return to an ordered state WITHOUT the input of energy, but the probability of such an occurrence is extremely low, just as billiard balls happening to collect back at the center of the pool table is extremely low. Being in an ordered state would likely have HIGHER energy, especially potential energy. If you look at the example of the molecules all crammed into one side of the box rather than being diffused throughout, the probability that they would bounce into each other is much greater, and therefore they exhibit a greater potential for increasing the kinetic energy of each molecule.

Also, dominant trait really helps for the plant to survive. But, if there are changes in environment or you somehow experimentally change environments or transplant plant to another climate - it may either die or adapt so new population of dwarf plants successfully thrive.

"Bear in mind that the aforementioned molecules are in a hectic state, frequently colliding and interacting. The possibilities you theorized in your questions do indeed occur; this is precisely why organic reactions almost never have 100% yields of the desired products. Mechanisms presented in lectures are not telling you exactly how each type of molecule in a solution interacts with the others, but rather highlights a certain pathway that produces the product of interest. Furthermore, these mechanisms are often simplified, and side reactions can also eventually give rise to the major products via more complicated pathways. Extending this concept to this particular reaction, remember that the steps are in equilibrium, meaning that although other products (such as the ones you mentioned) do form, they are less stable and easily revert back to their previous forms; given enough time, the reaction will favor the most stable product(s).

Different DNA molecules (and even regions within DNA molecules) can have different ratios of GC to AT base pairs. This is known as the GC content (and reportedly varies from 75% to 13.5%). GC content affects the physical properties of DNA - the most important being the ''melting temperature' (Tm) - the temperature around which two strands of DNA will separate.

In 1940 the IUPAC recommended that the term 'Stock number' (I, II, III, IV, etc.) be replaced by the term 'oxidation number' with Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.).

The more electrons in the DNA fragment, the stronger the intermolecular london forces of attraction between the DNA fragment and the gel molecules so the greater the viscous drag experienced by the DNA fragment.

"The 4s and 3d subshells have nearly the same energy level. How much of a difference, and which subshell is lower in energy, varies by element. In scandium and the other d block members of period 4, the 3d is lower in energy than the 4s. However, because the 3d orbitals are smaller and more closely packed than the 4s, the electron-electron repulsion that occurs in the 3d subshell is enough to make it possible for 1 or 2 electrons to have a lower energy by occupying the 4s. So, we have 3d and 4s co-filling rather than filling independently. So, with scandium, the first electron after completing the previous noble gas configuration goes into 3d. The difference in energy levels between 4s and 3d is small enough for the next two electrons to enter the 4s, because the electron-electron repulsion they feel if they enter 3d is enough to knock them into the 4s. The same process happens throughout the d-block. Sometimes the difference in energy levels between the s and d allows one electron to enter the s, sometimes it the difference allows 2 electrons to enter the s. And in palladium alone, the difference between d and s is so great that none of the electron are in the s. For the first few members to of Groups 1 and 2 there is no d to be filled. But with 4s-3d, 5s-4d, etc. there is the d to take into consideration. The explanation is simple: in Groups 1 and 2, but not in the d block, the s is lower in energy than the d. In the d block it is the other way around. Because the difference in energy levels between 4s-3d, 5s-4d, etc. varies by element, we have to look at each element on a case-by-case basis to see how these will fill. Similar irregularities appear in the f block, only now there are s, d and f subshells all with similar energy levels.",Electron,"Is it because the repulsion of the electrons filling the 3rd shell makes it 'harder' for the electrons to occupy that state rather than the 4s state, despite the last is of higher energy state?"

"Carbon has 4 valence electrons, and its electron configuration is 1s^2 2s^2 2p^2. Now, in order for carbon to bond appropriately 4 times you could promote an electron from the 2s orbital to the 2p orbital (thus giving you 2s^1 and 2p^3). However, these orbitals still exist at different energy levels, and thus we use hybridization. In the case of C2H4, each carbon is bonded to 3 different molecules, and thus, we only need to have 3 hybrid orbitals; we use the 2s orbital and 2 of the 2p orbitals and the sp2 hybrid orbital is created. Under this configuration, 3 of the valence electrons are in the sp2 orbitals (the ones that bond with other atoms) while the last valence electron is in the p2 shell that was not hybridized",Atomic orbital,Why did it start out with one electron in the S2 orbital and and extra electron in the P orbital?
"With what you stated I don't see a solution to the question. You have 3 possible conditions: F1 = F2, F1 > F2, F1 < F2 F1 = F2: Box wouldn't move and no work would be done. F1 > F2: Box moves right and the work by F1 is positive and the work by F2 is negative. F1 < F2: Box moves left and the work by F1 is negative and the work by F2 is positive. Since both amounts of work you have given are positive I don't see a way to solve this. If the amounts of work are only the magnitude of the work then we can work with that. The F1 magnitude of work is greater than the the F2 magnitude of work so we can assume that F1 is greater than F2. Also since F2 is opposing the movement by F1 so the F2 work is opposing the work F1 is doing so the total work is 150 - 50 = 100 J. Now we know the total work we can assume that this all becomes kinetic energy we can use the Ek = (m * v^2)/2 so we have: 100 = (2 * v^2)/2 200 = 2 * v^2 100 = v^2 10 = v So you have a velocity of 10 m/s to the right",Velocity,What is the velocity of the box after the work has been done on it?

"metabolism is more like the whole system which is made of skeleton - anabolic and catabolic reactions. There are many ""circuits"", dots are connected (intermediates connected by enzymes which make anabolism and catabolism happen).

Co-enzymes are a co factor of a vitamin. They help facilitate functions of the cell. Co-enzymes are in a lot of different vitamins.,Cofactor (biochemistry),Are co-enzymes a different form of vitamin?
"the only way a solution can act as a buffer if it has some way of soaking up both added acid (H+) and added base (OH-). That is why a buffer needs to have significant amounts of both a weak acid AND its conjugate base. The weak acid can react with any added base to neutralize the base, and the conjugate base (which is a weak base) can react with any added acid to neutralize the acid. These reactions are how a buffer keeps the pH from changing too much when acids or bases are added. The reason why a weak acid alone is usually not a very good buffer is that by definition, weak acids don't dissociate very much in solution. So that means a weak acid solution (let's call it HA) contains mostly undissociated weak acid HA, and not much of the conjugate base, A-. So it won't be very good at soaking up added acid, and it won't make a good buffer. We can fix that by increasing the amount of A- in the solution, either by adding an external source of A- (usually by adding some salt that contains A-, perhaps NaA), or by adding some strong base like NaOH. The strong base reacts with HA to make water and A-, the conjugate base! So that's another way to increase the A- concentration, by neutralizing some of the weak acid HA (but not all of the HA, since we still need both HA and A- around to make a good buffer).",Conjugate (acid-base theory),Where does the extra salt (conjugate base) come in?
"A tRNA contains hairpins though the hairpins play different roles in the two cases. In transcription termination, the hairpin causes the RNA polymerase to stall and the transcript to separate from the DNA. In a tRNA, multiple hairpins form and give the tRNA molecule the 3D shape it needs to perform its job of delivering amino acids.",Transfer RNA,Is tRNA formed from these hairpin structures?
"Technically, the mucus has two routes--it can either slide down the throat, or it can be ejected (when we sneeze or blow our nose) out the airway. If it is ejected, then that takes care of that as far as the body is concerned. If it slides down to the stomach, then our stomach acids can (hopefully) kill the germs contained within. As to your question, ""Why hasn't the body evolved [differently]..."", that's a bit more philosophical. From an evolutionary standpoint, there probably isn't enough of a reproductive disadvantage to warrant such an adaptation. We have cough and vomiting reflexes as ways to keep germs/poisons out of our bodies after all--perhaps avoiding the ""solid"" stuff isn't necessary?",Stomach,Why hasn't the body evolved so that 'solid' stuff doesn't travel from the nose to the stomach?
The charge on the ion is the sum of all the + and - charges on all the atoms in the ion. Usually only one atom has the charge and the other atoms have no charge.,Atom,Does all the atoms in the ion need to be negative or positive for the entire to be that charge?
"The blood constantly carries oxygen away on red blood cells and brings blood with little oxygen back, so from the point of view of the lungs, the blood never has enough oxygen and most of the oxygen diffuses in",Oxygen,"Does all the oxygen diffuse in or does half diffuse in, so that the concentration gradient is balanced?"
"Both electrons are associated with both atoms, before both electrons being associated with only the oxygen atom. When the electrons are shared between the carbon and oxygen atoms so are their charges. Half the time each electron would be smeared around the carbon atom and the other half the time it would be smeared around the oxygen atom. Before each electron would be spending their whole time smeared around the oxygen.",Electron,Would both electrons donated surely be associated with both ions?
"Electrons are not made up of anything smaller. They are just electrons. Protons and neutrons are made up of smaller particles called quarks. Protons and neutrons are made up of different mixtures of quarks, so they have different properties. Yes, all protons, electrons and neutrons are the same. Except for mass (how much something 'weighs'), most of the physical and chemical properties of atoms are caused by the very complicated ways in which their electromagnetic fields interact at a microscopic level. Thus, when you mix different kinds of atoms together, you get complicated changes in their electromagnetic fields. Sometimes these are major changes, sometimes these are minor changes. When oxygen and hydrogen mix together to make water, they release a tremendous amount of energy, and you wind up with two atoms of hydrogen being held (we call that 'bonded') to one atom of oxygen. You have the same atoms, but the amount of energy they have now is much, much less and their electrical fields have radically changed. Thus, water is not much like hydrogen or oxygen, but has its own properties. A better analogy than mixing paint is mixing wheat, water, and oil (and a few minor ingredients). Think of all the things you can make with just these three things depending on how much of each you use and how you put them together. You can get dough, biscuits, noodles, pudding, breakfast cereal, glue, gravy, sauces, a variety of wheat beers, farina, etc. It all depends on how much of the components you use and just how you go about putting them together. Much the same thing happens at the microscopic level -- what you get depends on how much you have of a few basic 'ingredients' and how you go about putting them together.",Proton,"How is it that these 3 parts (electron, proton, and neutron) can combine into different things just based on how many of these 'parts' there are?"
A resistor has a well-behaved action (Ohm's Law) and a clear and constant value of R. A spark is a rather violent and ever-changing current path. People can think of a spark as a wire made of torn-apart air molecules.,Resistor,Can people consider the air gap between the switch ends as a resistor that drops 3000V to 0?
"To make it easier to follow electron movement, we usually draw all the free electron pairs and electrons on atoms. In the case of a homolytic bond breakage, the atom is left with a single electron. Thats why we show a dot on each atom. A radical is usually very reactive and likes to bond quickly. So most of the time a radical won't stay radical for a long time.",Electron,Wouldn't be they unstable and would be in a need of gaining electrons?
"Chloride anions are stabilized in water because of the interaction between polar H's of the water molecules. However, in the reaction in the video, SOCl2 is used, which is highly reactive with water, forming HCl and SO2. Consequently, water is not the solvent being used in a reaction like this. So without water stabilising the Cl- anions, they readily act as bases and nucleophiles.",Nucleophile,How chloride would function as a good base or nucleophile?
"Snow forms when water vapor in the air turns directly into ice because it's so cold. The ice crystals grow from additional water vapor until they fall down as snow. Hail, on the other hand, is created when existing liquid rain is carried into colder areas by updrafts and freezes into a ball of ice. Because the water in many clouds is supercooled (brought past the freezing point but still in liquid form), it is easily frozen and the hail gradually grows. This continues until the hailstone becomes too heavy to stay in the clouds and falls. ",Hail,What is the difference in the formation of snow and hailstones?
"During the flat bit of the phase transition diagram, where temperature doesn't change despite the addition of more heat, the ice is melting and there is a mixture of ice and liquid water.

"Using the D line of sodium, 589 nm, is the most common wavelength used and the only wavelength used in data tables tabulating the specific rotation's of enantiomers. But yes if you were to use a different wavelength of light then the specific rotation would be different than the specific rotations found using 589 nm. Hope that helps.",Wavelength,Will wavelength  change affect the observed rotation of the chiral molecule?
"Particles in air will be able to travel at speeds greater than the speed of sound (300m/s) but I don't think this will cause a sonic boom because think about what sound is: sound is caused by the movement (compression and rarefractions) of molecules in the air. Sonic booms do not exist in space because there is no air and sound can therefore not travel. For the tiniest molecule in air, there is practically no such thing as air for sonic boom: the air molecule is floating in a vacuum with other air molecules but it does not have anything to ""cause"" a boom through any medium.",Sonic boom,Would air particles perform a tiny sonic boom?
"In gene therapy we typically don't transfer plasmids into human cells. The details depend on the specific type of gene therapy, but the techniques that have been used so far integrate new DNA sequences into one of the linear chromosome. ",Plasmid,How is a plasmid from a bacteria transferred to the human genome?
"The nucleolus is a region in the nucleus where the genes encoding rRNA (for ribosomes) are found. In fact, the structure of the nucleolus relies on transcription of these genes. The rRNA genes are found on several chromosomes. During mitosis, the chromosomes each condense and separate, so clearly the nucleolus can't stay around the whole time during mitosis. I would guess that there is more control to its disassembly though than just the surrounding DNA being pulled away during condensation.",Nucleolus,Why does nucleolus disappear and then reappear again?
"Nitrogen has five electrons that are available to form bonds. three of these electrons have formed covalent bonds with hydrogen and carbon, leaving two unbonded electrons that are in a single orbital - these two electrons are called a lone pair. The lone pair electrons can bond with a proton (H+), which is what is shown in the video. When this happens, unlike a usual covalent bond, both the electrons in the bond come from the nitrogen lone pair (a proton, has no electrons that it can share). This leaves the nitrogen atom with a positive charge. In effect, the positive charge that was on the proton is now transferred to the hydrogen atom.",Nitrogen,How could the N form another bond with a H?
"Deficiency in ATPase would not just cause diabetes and seizures but the ruckus in the whole body and many more connected diseases and defects. Seizures are caused because of energy insufficiency. Energetic insufficiency is not caused because of faulty ATPase but because of lack of disconnection between insulin levels in blood and available glucose molecules for uptake. Usually, there are faulty glucose receptors not recognizing and binding glucose or it could be insulin resistance (not producing insulin molecules at all). If a person administers insulin in its blood via injection and do _not_ eat food, may cause negative adverse effects - that is how diabetic seizures happen.",Seizure,How can this deficiency be corrected so ATP production is consistent enough (during fasts) to prevent energy related seizures from occurring?
"Natural selection is concerned with the viability of organisms as well as their fertility and reproductive rate. If an organism has lots of offspring that live long enough to successfully reproduce, that organisms traits will be selected FOR and pass into future generations. Conversely, if an organism is able to reproduce at an elevated rate, relative to other individuals of the same species, but its offspring don't survive to sexual maturity or are infertile, their traits will be selected AGAINST and will be lost from future generations. ",Natural selection,This is known as Natural Selection?
"Photons have no rest mass, but they do have energy, and from relativity energy and mass are equivalent, so the photon will interact with gravity for that reason. The other way of looking at it is what was mentioned before, that gravity curves spacetime and light follows the curved spacetime path.",Gravity,Why does gravity bend light?
"phase changes are as converting the incoming thermal energy (when you're heating something up) to potential/phase energy. In a certain phase, such a solid, the particles can only move so much because its IMF is holding them together. At a certain point, the incoming thermal energy can't make the particles move any faster/KE can't increase because of the phase it's in. Instead, the energy is converted to phase energy and allows the particles to break free of their IMF. When the energy is converted to phase energy, you're right in that there is a tiny drop in temperature but it's replaced almost immediately when you're continuously adding energy into a substance",Phase transition,How the temperature can stay constant during a phase change?
"Active transport is a process that uses energy from respiration. Diffusion and osmosis don't require the cell to expend any of its own energy, as they are passive processes. Diffusion is the spreading out of particles in a *gas or solution* resulting in the *net* movement of these particles from an area of *higher* concentration to an area of *lower* concentration Osmosis is the movement of *water* particles from a *dilute* solution to a *more* concentrated solution through a *selectively permeable membrane* As we know both are passive processes and yet (in basic, short terms) diffusion is higher to lower and osmosis is lower to higher, so movement to concentration doesn't determine whether it is active or passive.",Active transport,Shouldn't Osmosis technically be classified as a form of active transport?

"Metabolism definitely varies between people. Metabolism can be defined as the sum of all of the chemical reactions occurring inside of a living organism. Metabolism varies depending on the conditions present inside of the organism. The human body can speed up and slow down the rates of different chemical processes simultaneously in an attempt to maintain homeostasis. So weight can affect metabolism, but it certainly isn't the only factor that does so. A person's activity level, hormone levels, age, energy intake, and overall health can also impact metabolism.",Metabolism,Does metabolism vary widely between people?
"Meisosi II is a restorer. Why? Because the final product of meiosis * gametes * is_ Haploid cells. Remember, eggs and sperm are haploid, which makes sense. Why are they haploid? Otherwise, in each meiotic cycle, the number of chromosomes will double, resulting in polyploid and polyploid fertilized eggs (incompatible with life). To avoid all this, meiosis II is a reduction.",Meiosis,Is meosis 2 the only key point in regulating the amount of genetic material in haploid cells?
The ribosomal proteins are imported into the nucleus from the cytoplasm (through the nuclear pore complex). They then go to the nucleolus where they bind to rRNA to make ribosomal subunits. ,Nucleolus,How does the nucleolus make Ribosomal subunits?
"An amino acid has the general formula H2N-CH(R)-COOH, where R stands for the different acids. Notice that the central C atom is chiral - it has four different groups attached - so the molecule can exist as a pair of enantiomers (nonsuperimposable mirror images). One of these is the D isomer, and the other is L (i.e. a pair of R/S isomers). There are about 20 amino acids normally found in the human body. All of them are the L-isomers.",Amino acid,What is the basic difference between the L and D amino acids?
"Chocolate contains phenylalanine from two main sources: in the cocoa itself, and from the milk (protein component). someone has attempted to make chocolate with the phenylalanine removed for sufferers of PKU. People with PKU need to avoid phenylalanine during development, so it does not affect the growth of their brain etc. Some adults revert to diets with phenylalanine in them once they leave teenage years. However, many of these PKU sufferers find that if they eat phenylalanine as adults, it affects concentration, memory etc (and often attempt to return to a phenylalanine free diet). PKU sufferers eat phenylalanine or not is more of a choice, once they are adults. (Pregnant women are the exception, as high phenylalanine levels in the mother lead to microcephaly, growth retardation etc). So, adults with PKU can choose to eat chocolate, if sticking to a phenylalanine diet isn't important to them, without immediate serious consequences.",Phenylketonuria,People with phenylketonuria could never eat chocolate?
"a mutation is a mistake in the DNA, compared to what it should be. It is rare for it to happen, but there is also a lot of DNA in your cells. In a diploid human cell, there are over 6000 million basepairs of DNA. And when that is copied for cell division, mistakes can happen. this may be only one in a billion, but with billions of bases, you get some mistakes. As well as copying into the wrong base, maybe the polymerase doing the copying will slip and skip a base or so. Another way that mutations can happen if the DNA gets damaged and isn't repaired properly. This damage could be from x-rays, UV radiation, or mutagenic chemicals. They tend to cause different types of damage, which is repaired in different ways. Sometimes DNA is damaged in a way that both strands break, and the cell will try to glue them back together. However, this is not always perfect and mistakes can be introduced. There may be bases missing, especially if the nucleotides at the DNA ends were damaged so they couldn't be stuck straight onto each other.",Mutation,Is a mutation like a mistake in the DNA?

"When we talk about acid and base reactions, reactivity (and acidity and basicity) is all relative. In this particular case, acetic acid usually acts as the acid (the proton donor) because it is much better acid than water. Part of this has to do with the products of this acid-base reaction: the acetate ion, CH3COO-, is pretty good at stabilizing the negative charge using resonance. You are right that the lone pairs on the oxygens in acetic acid could technically grab a proton from water instead of donating it.Since OH- is a strong base (much stronger than acetic acid), it would grab a proton back and hang onto it very tightly. So that is not a super likely scenario due to acetic acid being a much stronger acid than water, or another way to think about it is that water is a better base than acetic acid. ",Acetic acid,Can the acetic acid grab a proton from water instead of donating it?
"A nitrogen atom with three bonds and a lone pair is technically a chiral center, but typically it can convert back and forth between conformations so quickly that in practice, you wouldn't be able to isolate the enantiomers. ",Nitrogen,Is a nitrogen atom with three bonds and a lone pair not considered a chiral center?
"The reactants have more energy, but this energy is not free energy. It is in the form of potential energy stored in the bonds. This energy is released into the environment in an exergonic reaction, bond breaking subsequently occurs. The products therefore have less energy because less bonds the equivalent of less energy.",Exergonic reaction,How come the reactants in an exergonic reaction have MORE free energy than the products?
We cant treat light the same way we treat matter because daily things travel very slowly but when you are travelling at speeds beyond 10^6 ms^-1 the science is different matter and energy are interconvertible (e=mc^2) so it doesn't really store energy it is energy itself.,Energy,Where does the photon store energy?

"Helium is not truly a member of Group 18 (or Group VIII in the older system). We just place it there because it is unique and does not really fit into any group. It is placed there because it is practically inert, like the other noble gases. Not all elements follow the octet rule. H, He, Li, and Be never follow the Octet Rule. Boron usually does not follow the octet rule, though it sometimes does. Other elements, such as S and P, sometimes do not follow the octet rule. So, the octet rule is not a strict law of science that is always followed.",Helium,Why does helium not have 8 valence electrons?
"from both a technical and practical point of view: Technically, lets say that maybe once upon a time, there were only brown-eyed humans. Then, one day, while a baby was being created in the mother's body, the genetics made a mistake while creating the baby, creating a little oopsie in the genetic material. We usually think of mutants as horrible half-humans with disfigurations, but originally, things like blue eyes were mutations in the human genome reflected in their phenotype (appearance). Practically, variation is really great for all living things. Say there's a whole field of purple and white flowers, and one day a disease comes along that, because the two flower colors are slightly genetically different, can only kill the purple flowers. If the species had no variation, they would have all died, but the white flowers were saved due to their differences.",Species,Why do species vary?

The bonds in hexane were broken then you wouldn't have hexane anymore. Hydrogen bonding only occurs when a hydrogen is covalently bonded to an electronegative atom.,Hydrogen,Couldn't those bonds be broken to release positive and negative hydrogen and carbon?
"Albinism is an autosomal recessive condition, meaning that a person must inherit TWO copies of the affected allele from his/her parents in order to display the phenotype. Thus, if one child is albino, you can assume that the parents are either a) both carriers (i.e. heterozygous for the trait) or b) both affected. Considering your question, we can assume that the parents are both carriers (since the chance that two children would inherit the disease if both parents are albino would be 100%). We must also consider the fact that these are independent events, meaning that having one child with albinism does NOT affect the chance of having another child with the condition. By the rules of probability, this means that we must multiply the number of chances of having a child affected by albinism to figure out the total probability of having TWO children with albinism. So, what is the probability of having a child with albinism given both parents are heterozygous? If you do a punned square for Aa x Aa, you get that the chance of having a child with albinism is 25%. This means that the chance of having a normal child is 75%. So, you just multiply 0.25 by 0.75 and get 0.1875. Thus, the chance of having a normal child is 19%",Normal (geometry),What is the chance the second child will be normal?

"Water is what is considered a 'permeability exception'. This is because water is polar, however it still diffuses readily through the hydrophobic core via osmosis. It does so by undergoing something called a ""Dipole moment"" wherein the unequal charge distribution of the molecule disappears just long enough to cross the membrane. However, from a basic perspective people will still say that water is impermeable due to its polarity and it diffuses very slowly.",Hydrophobe,How can water pass through the hydrophobic part of the cell?
Protonation is necessary for shifting formal charges between molecules. This exchange of charge whether it is adding or losing a proton is how molecules combine and separate. Don't get overwhelmed by the multiple steps in this mechanism even though there are a lot. The reason why there are so many protonation reactions is because the carboxylic acid has to be altered in multiple ways at different points to yield an ester. If you get confused just think of the reaction as simply this: adding an R group to the hydroxyl group (OH) of a carboxylic acid via an oxygen bond. To answer your second question: there is only one alcohol that is is used to protonate and deprotonate the the carboxylic acid and provide the R group that is to be attached.,Ethanol,Is it just the same alcohol hanging around and shuttling protons around?

"For autosomal recessive where there is no skipped generation, the other parent must be heterozygous for the trait, which would mean the children have a chance of having the recessive trait through inheriting the recessive chromosome from the carrier parent. For X-linked recessive, the same is true, with one parent being a carrier. Ways to prove X-linked recessive are that if the trait is recessive, there will be mother-son and/or daughter-father links. This means that if the mother is affected, the son must be as he must inherit one of her affected X chromosomes. The same is true with daughter-father links. If the daughter is affected then the father must also be as she will inherit one of her X chromosomes from him.",Dominance (genetics),How to figure out that the trait is recessive?
"That would depend on the species that was collapsing. If it was a minor organism, as in one that affected an organism with many other options for energy, the chance of that happening is very low. However, if it was a crucial organism that played a large part in energy sharing for that ecosystem, there could be a possibility of collapse. Once an ecosystem collapses, it is very hard, if not impossible, for it to recover.

"If complex 2 got the electrons first then moving the electrons to complex 1 would 'uphill' (endergonic)! the point of these reactions is to create as large a ""proton"" gradient (PMF) as possible (by pumping as many H+ across the membrane as possible). complex 2 is designed to ignore NADH and thus more of the energy associated with the electrons in NADH is converted into energy stored in the PMF.",Electron,Is not complex 2 supposed to have more ability to gain electrons?
"DNA not more acidic because they are more reactive, they are acidic because they have a tendency to shed H+ ions in water.

Therefore, due to the variation in how many organisms would get infected, it would still be considered dependent. However, if there were a disease that could only infect, per se 10 organisms no matter the population density, then I believe it would be considered independent because the disease's infection rate doesn't depend on the population density.",Infection,If disease was so good at infecting that many individuals could get infected?
"thoughts are a result, a result of our imagination , and the happenings around us. We think about something or the other every time . Suppose you saw a flower , now for that flower there will be so many observations made by our sense organs and transferred to brain for processing; for example its color, fragrance, size, type, the memories you have connected to it , and so so many details that we don't ever realize while doing any work. For different things our brain uses different parts and neurons for communication. Just imagine if this much work is done and at such tremendous speed, how high amount of energy would be required for just a single thought! I wanted to make the point that thought can't be a form of energy",Energy,How could we convert that form of energy into a thought?
"Dead cells' pieces, called 'apoptotic bodies', are eliminated by phagocitosis by nearby cells, such as macrophages.

"The standard heat of formation of a compound is defined as 'the change of enthalpy during the formation of 1 mole of the substance from its constituent elements, with all substances in their standard states, and at a pressure of 1 bar (100 kPa)'. The phrase 'standard state' includes the most stable form in which you find the element and the most stable elemental forms of hydrogen and oxygen are H2 and O2. Consequently, there is no change when H2 is formed from H2, or O2 is formed from O2, and hence the heats of formation are zero.",Standard enthalpy of formation,Why heat of formation of H2 and O2 is 0?

"The magnetic field is steady, but the sample is being irradiated with radiofrequency energy (light). The proton absorbs the energy and flips to a higher-energy state, similar to the way an electron absorbs energy and goes to a higher energy state.",Proton,Does the proton absorb the light similar to an electron and use the energy to change its spin state?
"The currently accepted definition of species says that only individuals of the same species may leave fertile offspring. While interspecies breeding is possible (liger, zebroid, etc) they cannot further reproduce and pass down 'new traits'. From the evolutionary point of view, that way of speciation is not possible (that fast, and dramatic change overnight). It _can_ affect biodiversity, but again on the shorter scale and just temporarily (following the lifetime of that individual). However, that is not likely to happen, because different species have a variety of mechanisms to stop and prevent cross-breeding or pollinating (either they reproduce at different parts of the year, or are physically incompatible, etc). Researchers may do the experiment and force starfishes in an aquarium to breed but that would not make much sense and effect on whole biodiversity",Biodiversity,How would that affect the biodiversity?

"The reason sodium and chlorine are so volatile is because they are extremely unstable. Chlorine's last shell has one too few electrons, and is therefore searching anywhere it can for that last electron. Sodium, on the other hand, has only one electron in its last shell, ergo it searches everywhere for something to give up that extra electron to. When sodium meets chlorine, the sodium gives its extra electron to chlorine (which has the one missing electron), which effectively creates a stable compound, NaCl, or halite (common table salt)",Chlorine,Why does chlorine and sodium become stable after?
"There is a paper: The mobility of DNA was always less in the gels with EtBr. change in friction is greatest in the largest fragments, which suggests that the stiffening of the molecule by the EtBr binding is the cause for the decreased mobility. even sample is affected, therefore whole gel is going at a slower pace.",Ethidium bromide,Does the addition of EtBr not slow down the rate at which the sample runs?
"high levels of prolactin in men are typically due to a tumor or abnormal growth of the pituitary gland (some medications may also cause this). In some men, excess prolactin decreases the amount of GnRH, gonadatropin releasing hormone made by the Hypothalamus which then decreases the amount of FSH and LH made by the anterior pituitary so the testes become smaller. (1. The area of erectile dysfunction is an area of present research and more information may become available in a journal search. 2.

"In the camera, as well in many machines you don't use the electron energy, but only the energy that pushes the electrons on the pathway. The electrons are only the carriers of the energy. But the internal energies of the electrons are not used (yet). Many persons don't fit on this: electric energy is not the energy of the electron: is the kinetic energy that is transformed from waterfalls (hydrelectric), thermoelectric generators, etc, that put potential energy and the potential energy difference (Volt) to electron movements. So, the machines uses that energy transforming into its uses (mechanical movement of the obturator, the digital LCD that guide you to take a best picture, etc. But the image reception occur with other source: the photossensitivity of many microLEDs with special features of transform photonic energy into voltage (potential energy diference), and that send to the microprocessor to calculate the spatial position of each microreceptiveLED, its voltage intensity to bright.",Electrical energy,What is this electrical energy converted to when I take a photo?

"The word lumen is used a lot in biology for the space inside a tube, such as the inside of blood vessels or intestines. It is also used for the space inside the E.R. The lumen is technically the inside of the E.R.. the ER is a continuation of the outer nuclear membrane. The lumen is basically the inside of the ER. So if you picture a slide, the slide is the ER. The part where you sit and go down is the lumen of the slide, or ER. Tubules and sacs of ER are interconnected and the ER membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single internal space. The ER membrane separates the ER lumen from the cytosol, and it mediates the selective transfer of molecules between these two compartments. Almost all of the proteins that will be secreted to the cell exterior and those for the lumen of the ER, Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes are initially delivered to the ER lumen.",Lumen (anatomy),What purpose does the E.R lumen serve?

There is a weak attraction between carbon and oxygen of h2o. Hexane is slightly soluble in water (9.5 mg/L). This is primarily due to London dispersion forces rather than the small degree of polarity found in C-H bonds. (Hexane is actually a more-or-less completely non-polar molecule since it is symmetrical.) Solubility is on a continuum rather than being binary ac'A. Almost everything is soluble in almost any solvent to some degree.,Oxygen,Why does carbon not attract with oxygen of h2o?

"It would be violating the octet rule if an additional electron pair moved to oxygen. Since oxygen contains a full octet, the electronegativity of oxygen is greatly reduced because its effective nuclear charge is essentially 0. This means that oxygen is now not pulling on electrons as much as if it did not have a full octet. If electrons moved towards oxygen then 10 electrons would be around oxygen which does not occur. Although, carbon anions are high energy species, the mechanism is a concerted process in which a proton is removed from the primary alcohol to lower the energy of the system.",Oxygen,Why does that push double bond to Carbon instead of either oxygen that is connected to S?

"Oxidation numbers can vary quite a lot for some atoms, but are very consistent for others. Oxygen is actually among the most reliable atoms, as far as oxidation number. It nearly always counts for 2-, except when it's part of a peroxide, when it is instead 1-. Fluorine has a 1-, with no exceptions. Other halogens also tend to have 1-, unless there is oxygen involved, as in polyatomic ions like chlorate and chlorite. This makes sense if you think about electronegativity. Halogens are pretty electronegative, and tend to pull an electron toward them. But if you compare the actual EN values, oxygen is actually more electronegative than anything but fluorine, and tends to pull electrons away from even chlorine and the rest. Fluorine is always 1-, because it pulls hardest, and only wants one electron, while oxygen pulls almost as hard, and wants two electrons, so it is almost always 2-. It's also important to remember that in a pure element, the oxidation number is 0, *by definition*. So, in O2, both oxygen atoms have oxidation number 0, just as both fluorines in F2 have 0, and so on.",Oxidation state,How to work out what its oxidation number is?
"Facilitated delineates that something is required for diffusion to take place, that is, the small transmembrane protein that allows the movement of the water molecules across the plasma membranes. Generally speaking, the movement of water via osmosis is through simple diffusion of the water molecules across a semi-permeable membrane, from a more dilute to a more concentrated region. Since this diffusion process does not require the additional 'help' of an embedded integral protein, the diffusion is not 'facilitated.'",Diffusion,Why is movement of water not considered facilitated diffusion?

"We cannot obtain usable nitrogen through breathing. Nitrogen has to be fixed into a usable form first before it is consumed by heterotrophs. We can't take in nitrogen in the atmosphere because it is N2. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria converts the N2 into ammonium (NH4), which gets converted into nitrates (NO3) and nitrites (NO2-).

Theoretically, we can't prove the existence of the core of the earth but there is no other way that the magnetic field of the earth and other planets are possible. It even explains the lack of magnetic field for things like the moon or Mars. Everything in science is a theory.

"The main principle is that when you neutralise an acid and base, moles acid = moles base You should also have the volume of base that was titrated because that will have been in the burette so was measured. concentration = moles / volume Or rearranged: moles = concentration x volume So calculate moles of base If the stoichiometry from the balanced equation is 1:1 then this is equal to the moles of acid. If it isn't then you'll need to account for that. Now you have moles of acid, and the initial volume so just use the previous equation: concentration = moles / volume Now I've explained the method, there is a shortcut you can use here. C1V1/n1 = C2V2/n2 where n1 and n2 are the coefficients of the acid and base in the balanced equation. You will always know 5/6 of the values in that.",Acid,How would you find the molarity of the acid?
"only a few surface molecules have the required amount of kinetic energy to vaporise, we add heat to the liquid to add kinetic energy to the molecules so that an even larger amount of them vaporise.

"Acceleration implies force. If we have constant velocity that means that we don't have acceleration. If we don't have an acceleration, that means that there's no force involved. In real life, yes. If we only focus on classical mechanics and not the physics behind it that explains more profoundly why it works like that, I can't think of any force that doesn't have an opposing force. Every material has an associate coefficient of friction. If there's no force such as friction or air resistance, objects would experience a constant acceleration, meaning they would be speeding up until reaching the speed of light all the time. Because if we are at a rest (0 velocity) and want to change our velocity we need a force. And that force wouldn't had a counterpart. We would be constantly accelerating, making life pretty difficult. If not, not viable.",Drag (physics),But what if there isn't a force such as friction or air resistance?
"the changing concentrations have nothing to do with the order, and in fact, the way in which they change *is* in fact the order. So, if they were not changing, then we cannot determine the order. cancelling out the effect of all but one reactant is the standard method of finding the order. The method used is called flooding. In this, all but one are taken in very high concentrations (excess) such that even if the entire reaction were to take place and our reactant (in small amount) were to be entirely consumed, the net change in the concentrations of the remaining would be negligible, and hence can be taken as zero (constant concentration). Hence all their concentration along with the actual rate constant now form a new constant which can be computed while measuring the rate with respect to one reactant only. By doing this for every reactant, the original constant can be determined. To note, although we are taking the concentrations to be constant, it is just a mathematical step (the change being closed to zero) and not in reality, since their concentrations need to change for the reaction to occur (or at least, they need to be used up)",Reagent,Is there anyway to cancel out the effect of other reactant?
"Bromine has a negative charge when it has a full octet; this makes it an negative anion so it wants to bond with a positive carbocation.(Unlike charges attract), a bromine atom is neutral when it has 7 valence electrons.

"Implicit in this question is a view that light is a wave, because waves need mediums. If light were a particle, you would not need to ask this question, right? And that puzzled physicists for about 300 years, because light does things that seem particle-like (it travels without needing a medium, for example) and it does things that seem wave-like (it diffracts, refracts, polarizes). So which is it, a particle or a wave? It is neither. Light does not care that we would like to put it in one of two categories that are familiar to us. It is its own thing. It is a thing that happens to sometimes behave in ways that seem particle-like to us, and sometimes behave in ways that seem wave-like to us, but that does not mean it is one or the other or both of those things. Newton thought light was a particle, but then for a long time the prevailing view was that it was a wave, a perspective that was reinforced by Maxwell's discovery of the equations that govern electromagnetism. Embedded in his equations was the notion that electromagnetic waves travel at a speed of 3*10^8 m/s. It was known that this was also the speed of light, so physicists concluded that light is an electromagnetic wave. This wave view, though, started to get in trouble in the late 1800's as physicists struggled and failed to find the medium that this wave was traveling through. It was not until the early 1900's that physicists, largely thanks to Einstein, finally realized that we have to accept light on its own terms rather than force it into a category that is more familiar to us.",Fast bowling,"Is light itself a medium, that others waves can travel through?"
"That could happen, but it is unlikely. Remember that there are only a few free Cl atoms at any one time, but there are lots of CH4 molecules. The chances of a Cl atom hitting a CH4 molecule are much greater than of its hitting anything else, so you are going to get mostly CH3Cl. If you have lots of Cl2, then towards the end of the reaction, when you have more CH3Cl, the Cl atom will start hitting the CH3Cl molecules and forming CHCl2. ",Chlorine,The chlorine is more reactive than the hydrogen the hydrogen should form an H2 molecule?
"The point of a system being a constant pressure system is that the pressure remains constant.

"At the scale of the individual molecule having a positive charge at one end and a negative charge at the other end of a molecule is very different from having no charges at all.

"The difference between 'log' and 'ln' is: If you just have 'log' (without a base underneath) it means it is base 10, it is implied. On the other hand if you have 'ln', it is implied that you have a base of 'e' (Euler's constant). Logarithms are largely used in a lot of different fields of study, and their base depends on the phenomenon that you are referring to (basically, you use the one that helps you the best to explain that certain phenomenon), that's why sometimes you might even find bases even different than e or 10, although these are the ones that are used the most.",Natural logarithm,Isn't the log base e is equal to ln?
"Natural selection is based upon the premise that the most fit organism for an environment (so the organism which has the best traits for a given set of circumstances) will inevitably produce the most offspring due to it being the most fit. As such it will pass on more of its genetic information to the next generation. Those organisms who are less fit for an environment, will not produce as many offspring, and their genetic information won't be as prevalent in the next generation of their species. As time progresses, the most fit organism's preferred genetic traits (the traits that made the organism fit) will become more and more prevalent in the species. That is nature selecting for the most fit organism's traits, hence the name Natural Selection.",Natural selection,This is known as Natural Selection?
"sexual reproduction evolved via natural selection. Some very primitive form of sexual reproduction (probably just sharing DNA randomly between single cells) led to greater variation in one population vs another. On a population scale, sexual reproduction clearly offers a selective advantage. The new-found variation means that the population as a whole can thrive in a wider variety of conditions because individuals are less similar to each other and the population as a whole can therefore survive in a wider variety of conditions. For example, let's say there is a population of cells that normally can survive in only dry, hot conditions. Let's say that through random mutation (which is pretty rare), one member of that population develops an allele of a gene that allows it to survive in humid conditions, and another member develops an allele of a different gene that allows it to survive in cold conditions. If the population can only reproduce asexually (i.e. by budding off clones), you would never find an individual that could survive both humidity AND cold. So, if the desert where this population of cells lives cooled AND humidified (maybe there's an ice age), none of the individuals of that asexually reproducing population would survive. BUT, if they did reproduce sexually, there could be an individual with BOTH new alleles who could survive both cold AND humidity. So in this scenario, sexual reproduction is a selective advantage over asexual reproduction. However, the original version of sexual reproduction was probably very, very simple compared to how it works in humans - remember, our version of sexual reproduction has had a ton of time to evolve its complexities.",Sexual reproduction,Why/how was sexual reproduction introduced?
"A magnet has a north pole and a south pole.

carbon will almost always follow the octet rule. CO isn't an exception to this. The third bond here comes from a lone pair on O being shared with C. the hybridisation is sp for both O and C.

So a triple bond in CO here does sense.,Triple bond,How does oxygen get a triple bond with carbon?
"In some environments HCl does behave like an ionic compound, but as a gas it forms molecules (i.e. shows covalent bonding). Note that it is better to think of covalent and ionic bonding as being on a continuum rather than as distinctly different types of bonding. Most bonds have both ionic and covalent character and in many cases it is actually quite arbitrary to call something one or the other. HCl is a great example of this, it has a polar covalent bond as a gas - this can be expressed as the bond having a mixture of covalent and ionic character. However, when dissolved in water, HCl almost completely dissociates with the protons binding to water molecules - and so the behavior of HCl in water is best described as being ionic. One way of thinking of this is that the nature of bonding in some compounds changes depending on the environment.",Ion,Why the HCl isn't ionic?

"In this particular case only the hydrogen atom can rearrange, which it does, turning the primary carbocation into a more stable secondary carbocation. This is called a hydride shift or a 1,2 hydride shift, because it happens between carbon 1 (with the positive charge) and carbon 2 (with the extra hydrogen). Now, what you are referring to is something called an alkyl shift or a 1,2 alkyl shift, in which a CH3 group from an adjacent carbon (Carbon # 2) does what the hydrogen does in the alkyl shift, and literally moves to the positive charge, while the positive charge takes its place. As far as I know, an alkyl shift can only happen if 1. The swap will move the positive charge to a more stable place, making the carbocation more stable and 2. The swap involves a single adjacent methyl group swapping with the + charge. Turning a butyl chloride into a tert-butyl would satisfy rule one, but it goes against rule two. The alkyl shift is a strange enough reaction on it own, having a reaction which reformats the molecule so extensively seems like it could not happen except under extreme conditions (extremely high heat, say).",Butyl group,E can't the cation be arranged to tertiary butyl?
"all enzymes have an optimal temperature and pH level at which they work best at. If the enzyme is working at high temperatures or out of range pH levels, there is a chance it could become denatured. Also, enzymes are proteins, and proteins are affected by temperature and pH values. When the temperature is too high, or at extreme values of pH, the enzymes undergoes conformational change (ie. change in shape) of the active site, also known as denaturation. The substrates no longer fit into the shape of the active site to form an enzyme-substrate complex, so the rate of the enzymatic reaction decreases.",Enzyme,How does the enzyme Lipase breakdown lipids/fats in milk?

"There are 20 'standard' amino acids encoded by the triplets of the genetic code. However there are two more, selenocysteine and pyrrolysine that are incorporated in response to a given triplet in combination with another signal. But they are then also incorporated via tRNA. There are other amino acids found in proteins, but they are modified after incorporation, for example hydroxylysine so there aren't tRNAs for these",Amino acid,How many different (natural) amino acids are there?
"Water is very common in the universe. At this time, we do not know how common liquid water might be in the universe but it is more likely that we would find it in either the solid or vapor form. This situation is nothing special about water, because the liquid phase of any chemical requires just the right ranges of both pressure and temperature. So, the liquid phase of mater is not all that common, relatively speaking. Just think about it, apart from liquid water, how many other naturally-occurring liquids do you encounter in your daily life? However, water does have a fairly wide range of temperatures and pressures it can be a liquid in, so it does have a better chance of being a liquid than many other substances. Hydrogen itself exists as a liquid in only the most extreme conditions, so it is extremely rare. Solid hydrogen is even more rare. Pure hydrogen mostly exists as a plasma in stars or elsewhere as a gas.",Universe,How common is water in the universe?

"Acids come in different strengths. Stronger acids dissociate more, so there is more H+ when they are dissolved in water. Thus, if you have any two acids in water with the same concentration, the pH will be lower (more H+) for the stronger acid. If you happened to have a diprotic acid that was just a little bit weaker than your monoprotic acid, it might be that the diprotic acid's double dissociation to give H+ just added up to match that of the monoprotic acid's single dissociation and they could have the same pH.",Acid,Does ph of a monoprotic acid and a diprotic acid is same?
"Passive transport basically does not require any form of energy compared to active transport.

"Technically, all people do have some amount of cancer in their bodies at any given time. mutations happen quite frequently, and while the damaged cells may not be malignant or available in large numbers, they still possess the qualities and damaged genetic code that many malignant, dangerous cancers have when they first develop. Because the amount of mutated cells in a healthy human is so small, there is no risk to the person's well-being. Oftentimes, these damaged cells will be destroyed or removed by the immune system, or by a built-in cellular system that employs tumor-suppressor genes to result in apoptosis, which is better known as 'cell suicide.' These cells know that they could become dangerous to the body, and thus destroy themselves to keep from spreading and polluting others anatomical structures.",Cancer,Are there many cancer cells in our body everyday?
"Meiosis indeed has a role in physical attributes. During P1, synapsis takes place. This is where the father and mother chromosome overlap and become mixed. This allows the new chromosome to be different from the mother and father chromosomes. This is essential as it causes variation. Variation helps people to be different from each other, allowing each person to be differentiated. It is also vital for survival. If many people/everyone had similar genes, the likelihood of all of them dying from a disease is the same (if it is potent, it is likely to wipe out those with similar genes). This is why sexual reproduction is better than asexual reproduction in this sense.",Meiosis,Does meiosis just determine your sex?

"In an acidic medium, H+ will be present (as H3O+, hydronium, in water; the H+ joins H2O to create H3O+, an equivalent form) in solution; this is the definition of an acid. The acid will release H+, leaving behind its conjugate base (the anion of the acid); how much H+ released depends on the acid's dissociation constant- strong acids will effectively dissociate completely and not be present as combined ions afterwards, but weak acids will mostly remain non-dissociated, and little H+ will be produced. For bases, the Arrhenius and Bronsted-Lowry definitions are different; Arrhenius bases release OH-, while Bronsted-Lowry bases remove H+ from water (or another solvent, as the Bronsted-Lowry model works in non-aqueous solutions) to leave OH-, along with the base's conjugate acid (the base with an added H+ ion). Most common Arrhenius bases are strong bases which dissociate completely; many Bronsted-Lowry bases are weak bases, in which much of the base remains whole in solution. The end result is that an acidic solution will have remaining H+ (or H3O+) in solution (concentration determines pH), and a basic solution will have remaining OH- in solution (concentration determines pOH)",Base (chemistry),Why do you use oh- in a basic medium?
"If placing a red blood cell in a hypotonic solution, it will burst. A hypotonic solution has a low solute concentration than the inside of the cells (solute concentration in the cell is high).

"Formal charge is the charge on a specific atom in a specific molecule. Formal charges are incredibly useful in chemistry because they help dictate how a reaction will proceed. Ionic bonds are bonds formed between two charged molecules. Charged molecules are called ions, which is why it's called an ionic bond. Ionic bonds are really useful for forming strong solids, even though they aren't as strong as covalent bonds. You can thank ionic bonds for the fact that table salt- NaCl- exists!

But it is neither of those things, it is its own thing, and our intuition that it must behave like the waves or particles we are used to does not apply, so we have to just deal with that and understand it as it is. Waves that we are familiar with need a medium. Light does not. Particles that we are familiar with do not diffract and refract and get polarized. Light does.

"Waves are disturbances right? So if you consider an example of force: say you're pulling a rope in x direction and your friend is pulling it in -x direction, with equal forces. It doesn't move as the forces cancel out. Same is with a wave. 1 wave disturbance is moving the rope up the other is moving it down so if they're equal they cancel each other out. If not then you use the same principle. In case of EM waves, I think it's the electromagnetic force that causes it.",Wave,Why waves behave this way?
"When the sodium ions move down their concentration gradient, the antiporter uses the energy transferred to it to change its shape so that it can accept the other molecules and push them in the opposite direction, against their concentration gradient.

"Atom have 4 electrons in the outermost shell can actually choose either or even stay neutral. One interesting thing about these types of subshells, is that they are actually somewhat stable. Because of the relative stability, these atoms often form covalent bonds rather than ionic bonds that need a charge. One example is Carbon. It has 4 valence electrons, so it can make a 4+ or a 4- charge. But because of its relatively stable half filled orbital, most of the time it takes part in covalent bonding like in organic molecules. On occasion, Carbon can ionize, most commonly 4+.",Electron,Will atom need to gain 4 electrons or lose 4 electrons to achieve an octet?

"Take honey for example, it is very viscous, but when it is heated it flows better. it's properties change. The heat from the fire or wherever it was heated from increased it's energy. When it was able to flow better, there is an increase in kinetic energy, making it less viscous than it usually is. Same goes for freezing.

"Whether a bond is perfectly non-polar or polar depends on the electronegativity differences between the two bonded atoms. There is a spectrum that ranges from the two extremes of non-polar covalent to ionic, with covalent polar in between. Even though two bonded atoms may be different, their differences in electronegativity might be slight and thus may still be bonding with a relatively equal sharing of electrons, such is the case of carbon bonded to hydrogen. The greater the electronegativity difference, the more the bond approaches the extreme of being ionic. About NaCl, there is a huge difference in electronegativity between the two atoms and it makes sense that this bond is ionic.

"The size of an atom does affect both the nuclear charge and the ionization energy. First of all, If an atom has more protons in its nucleus, then the nuclear charge will obviously be greater, so the ionization energy will be higher. But just as Jay said, you also have to take into account the distance between the electrons and the nucleus, as well as electron shielding/screening. A larger atom will have more distance between the nucleus and the farthest electrons, so it will be easier for that atom to lose an electron. Also, a larger atom will have more electrons, which will all repel each other and push the outer electrons away from the nucleus (at least, that's what I would think). Both of these factors will lower the ionization energy.",Ionization energy,"Would it correct to conclude that larger the atom, lower the ionization energy (since distance from the nucleus is higher)?"

When they colonize the environment, it is changed again which further makes the environment more suitable to a wider range of organisms, increasing biodiversity",Pioneer species,Why don't people see pioneer species dominating for long periods of time?
". You can have hailstones in different sizes due to a variety of factors. If a thunderstorm is more powerful, the updrafts will be able to keep the hailstone where it can grow for longer, making it bigger, for example. If the air is colder, then there is a greater zone for hailstones to grow, so they will be larger as well (but not too cold, as then the supercooled water has a harder time staying liquid).",Hail,Why are hailstones formed in different sizes?
"the Carbonyl group is how molecules are identified as sugars. The fact that each carbon atom is bonded to Hydroxyl groups except one carbon that is bonded to a Carbonyl group turns it into a sugar. fructose has a carbonyl group. this makes it into a sugar. This means that no matter how many Hydroxyl groups you have on a molecule, if it has a carbonyl group, it can't be an alcohol anymore, instead, it is classified as a sugar. all it takes is one atom for the entire molecule to be radically changed, in this case, the carbonyl group.",Hydroxy group,Do you need a full chain of only Hydroxyl to make it an alcohol?
"Oxygen in the air is usually in the form of O2, which is stable. Oxygen in water is bound to two hydrogens, which makes it stable as well - at least as far as connecting more oxygen to them goes. Oxygen can diffuse into water, but this happens very slowly if the water is still. It doesn't bond, it is a mixture. The oxygen can come back out as well. Agitation (movement) of the water will increase it's absorption of air. Water can also contain other substances through *pressure* and *solubility*. Oxygen can be pushed into water so that it is absorbed under pressure - given room to expand, the oxygen comes back out of the water and into the air. Henry's Law explains gas absorption into water, which involves a bit of chemistry. Water is what we call a solvent - it can absorb other substances because the oxygen is connected to the hydrogens by what are called ionic bonds, which leaves the oxygen with a negative charge and the two hydrogens with a positive charge, and these charges can pull other molecules like salt apart.",Oxygen,Why don't the oxygen atoms in the air bond to the water molecules on the surface and pull on water molecules?
"Intermolecular bonds break easier, but that does not mean first. Statistically, intermolecular bonds will break more often than covalent or ionic bonds. They can both break at the same time, it is just a matter of probability. Water, for example is always evaporating, even if not boiling. But, then, why no hydrogen or oxygen is observed as a product of pure water? Because water decomposes into H+ and OH- when the covalent bond breaks. The concentration of each of these ions in pure water, at 25 degree Celsius, and pressure of 1atm, is 1.0×10e−7mol/L... that is: covalent bonds are breaking all the time (self-ionization), just like intermolecular bonds (evaporation). By the way, that is what makes both pH and pOH of water equal 7. Note that even though H+ and OH- are naturally produced in water, they also recombine back into H2O. The speed of bonds breaking and the speed of recombination fight one another, until they are in chemical equilibrium, that is when both speeds are the same. For instance, this kind of fight also happens with evaporation inside a closed recipient. The equilibrium is reached when the number of molecules escaping from the liquid phase is the same as the number of molecules entering it.",Intermolecular force,Is there ever an instance where both the intermolecular bonds and intramolecular bonds break simultaneously?
"Both Na and Cl are still ions. The ions are simply separated due to their charges. If they weren't ions, then they wouldn't interact with the water molecules due to their neutral charges. The reason hydration shells are formed is due to the attraction between positive and negative charges.",Chlorine,Does sodium get the electron it originally gave to chlorine back again?
It depends on if dominant trait is a trait that is linked to the X or Y chromosomes. If dominant trait is not on the X or Y chromosomes then it makes no difference which sex has the XX or XY pair. If dominant trait is on the X or Y chromosomes you will need to define if dominant trait exists only on one of the X or Y or both.,Dominance (genetics),What is the probability that the male offspring will show the dominant trait?
"The half-life of a radioactive element is the time it takes before half of the atoms in a sample of the element have decayed. If you know how many atoms you have in a sample, and you measure how many of them decay per second, it is easy to figure out how long you would have to wait before half of all the atoms have decayed. You do not have to measure until half the atoms actually have decayed, but the tradition is that we use the half-life as a measure of how quickly a radioactive element decays.",Half-life,What is the technique that actually establishes the half-life time duration?
electrons fill up orbitals in the increasing order of energy. all three p orbitals are of the same energy so the second electron will rather go in the second orbital and have the same spin as the first one than go in the orbital where the first one is and have repulsing inverse spin. s orbital has smaller energy than p orbitals so it is more stable for electrons to have inverse spins in that lower energy state than for one electron to go into higher energy state,Atomic orbital,Why aren't they spaced out into newly created p orbitals?
"We can walk on Land because the number of irregularities present on the surface are very plentiful, and differ from area to area, whereas in water, there are no irregularities and it is actually often used only as a lubricant, which is why the wet floor is extremely difficult to walk on. So, technically the only reason we can walk on land and not on water is actually because the number of irregularities is present in solids and is absent in liquids",Water,Why we cannot walk in water?
The molarity you use to measure the equilibrium constant is the molarity at equilibrium.,Molar concentration,How to find the molarity of each soln at that point?
"The population might die out, but even if people find a new home, they will still die, and if all of the population moves away, then the population size and the allele freq. So, it would not be founder's effect. if the population mates with a slightly different population, or they mutate spontaneously in some way that allows them to have offspring, then they would live.",Founder effect,"Does the population will die out, or move away and (founder effect) find a new home?"
"Viruses are kind of the 'zombies' of the cell world - they are only active and able to reproduce if they have infected an organism. Outside of an organism, like in the air, they can do basically nothing. The only resemblance viruses have to cells is a small amount of DNA and the ability to reproduce - they have no other purpose.",Virus,Are virus living things?
"There are 4 types of binary fission in bacteria. Also, not all bacteria undergo binary fission, while E.coli and Salmonella do, many bacteria undergo genetical recombination such as transduction, conjugation, transformation. Binary fission as a mechanism is the same in principle. Conceptually this is a simple process; a cell just needs to grow to twice its starting size and then split in two.",Fission (biology),Does binary fission occur in the same way?
"Carbon 3 is chiral, but people can't determine its stereochemistry because there is not a dash or wedge to denote which group (methyl or hydrogen) is in front of the other.",Chirality (chemistry),Why is not the number 3 carbon chiral as well?
"If you remove a resistor from a parallel arrangement, the total current through the remaining resistors goes down. By removing a resistor, the overall equivalent parallel resistance goes UP, so the current goes DOWN.",Electric current,What would happen to total current?
"There are no ionic bonds in these. There is a charge due to having 1 more electron than it has protons, but every bond in these molecules is covalent. The reason the charge is that if you draw the structures you will end up with one oxygen only having 7 electrons and not following the octet rule, unless you add an extra electron to the molecule. Hence why the chlorine polyatomic ions have a -1 charge. You could also think of them all being protonated as acids: HClO, HClO2, HClO3 and HClO4. Once they lose the H+ a -1 charge is left.",Ionic bonding,Is hypochlorite only ionic bond?
"New genetic traits occurring that are not the result of novel gene combinations happen by mutations. These mutations happen as the gametes are forming. This is not all that unusual, most gametes have a few mutations. Most of the time the mutation has little or no effect on the phenotype. When there is an effect that matters, it is usually harmful. But, once in a while, the mutation is beneficial. There are many kinds of mutations. This is gene duplication. In gene duplication the offspring gets an extra copy of a gene, perhaps even on a completely different chromosome. Sometimes this is catastrophic, but a lot of times it can enhance an existing trait or simply just provide a backup copy of an existing gene. Gene duplication is a very common mutation and there are many genes we have extra copies of. Now, if we have a spare copy of a gene, then some of the time that allows a major mutation to occur in one of the copies without causing a catastrophic problem. Now, in particular, if one of the copies undergoes what is called a frameshift mutation, then that gene will now code for a completely different protein. This might do very little, might be harmful, or might actually cause a new trait to appear rather suddenly. There are documented cases of this kind of mutation.",Gene,"How to account for 'new' traits, and not just novel gene combinations?"
"Sodium potassium pump is very essential in maintaining the ionic concentratins of the sodium and potassium ions inside and outside cells. There are certain leaking channels which continuously leak potassium outwards, and many other processes which bring sodium in and potassium out. All of these processes are important for the functioning of the cell. The Na-K pump keeps pumping the K and Na appropriately, and maintaining the concentrations overall, and hence the osmolarity of the cell. Osmolarity determines the amount of water inside the cell, which remains well-balanced because of the constant work of the Na-K pump",Sodium–potassium pump,How does the sodium potassium pump help cells prevent losing or gaining too much water?
"Kidneys do get affected by UTI, and this is especially true for women and for those who have a genetic predisposition to kidney diseases.  worst thing is probably getting a chronic pyelonephritis , people had to exclude some products from my menu and drink more water than normal people. And after getting a kidney infection you get more vulnerable to them in the future. If untreated, kidney infections can cause blood poisoning, kidney scars and even permanent kidney damage. During pregnancy they can result in premature labor.",Kidney,What are the possible complications or consequences of a kidney infection?
"Na molecules  attach themselves to the negative charges that are sticking out, they do not clump because of the hydrogen bond that is formed.",Molecule,Why don't Na molecules attach there and form a clump?
"I think it comes down to semantics and the confusion arises because some biological texts use expressions such as our DNA ... or the DNA which gives the impression that DNA is a single entity - in fact, it is the genome that is being referred to in this context. But from a _chemistry_ point of view DNA is a molecule, and the DNA molecule in each chromosome is different, because the base sequence is different in each chromosome. An analogy is protein. We have a countless number of different proteins, and each is a molecule. Nonetheless, you still find texts that refer to protein in a generic sense.",DNA,Why do people still call DNA a molecule?
"The lines are definitely because the hydrogen atom is emitting that energy. When an electron goes from an orbital with high energy to one with lower energy, the energy difference has to go somewhere, and one of the places it can go is into a photon which is emitted in a random direction. The lines therefore tell you the energy differences of the different orbitals the electron can have around the atom. Measuring enough lines precisely enough lets you work out (among a lot of other things) which atom we are talking about and how many shells are filled.",Electron,Are the lines an indicator of maybe how many electron shells an atom has ?
"There is a mutation in the RNA preventing the drug from binding. The mutation is not harmful to the bacteria, the drug will no longer work",Bacteria,How can bacteria become resistant to antibiotics?
"Genes are not transcribed more than once per cycle. Also, the cell cannot splice DNA. there are not genes that do not get transcribed at all, even non-coding regions of DNA are transcribed. Because Polymerase does not skip or selectively transcribe, it follows the strand of DNA.",DNA,Wouldn't it be more practical for the cell to just splice the DNA strand itself?
"The aldehyde group had only one hydrogen attached to it. The NaBH4 added another H, which is shown explicitly in the centre structure. Both H atoms are still present in the final product. He wrote the structure as a bond-line structure. In a bond-line structure, you show only the carbon atoms, and the unfilled valences of carbon are assumed to be filled by hydrogen atoms. Thus, the C atom next to the alcohol group has two H atoms attached to it.",Hydrogen,Where did two Hydrogens go?
"Water has a high surface tension because the water molecules on the surface are pulled together by strong hydrogen bonds. That means a drop of water will ""Want"" to have the smallest possible surface area. The shape that has the smallest possible area for a given volume is a *sphere*. Water droplets tend to be somewhat flattened on Earth, but in space they are perfectly spherical. ",Surface tension,How surface tension applies to the shape of water droplet?
"there has to be a large amount of both the weak acid and its conjugate base (or vice versa) in order to neutralize the incoming acid/base that disturbs the solution. For example, I make a buffer with 1 mole of acetic acid and 1 mole of sodium acetate. If I were to drop a bit of strong base, let's say NaOH, into the solution, it would react with the 1 mole of acetic acid (acid) that is in the buffer. If i were to drop a bit of strong acid, let's say HCl, into the solution, it would react with the 1 mole of sodium acetate (base) that is in the buffer. Acids will react with bases. Now, let's pretend I make a second buffer, let's 0.1 moles of acetic acid and 1 mole of sodium acetate. This new buffer would be able to resist an incoming acid just as well as my first buffer, because it still has the same amount of sodium acetate (base). But it would be ineffective at neutralizing any incoming base because there is now only 0.1 moles of acetic acid to neutralize it. If we add too much base, we will quickly exceed the capacity of the buffer and the pH will skyrocket! Non-buffered solutions do not have any mechanism to resist changes in pH.",PH,What is the specific difference for a non-buffered solution that causes the pH to fluctuate?
"In bacteria, GUG can also work as start codon. for fate of peptides, just go through SIGNAL HYPOTHESIS. Those that don't (usually) occur due to removal or modification of the amino-terminal (start) methionine. For example, enzymes called ""methionine amino-peptidases"" cut off this amino acid from the beginning of some proteins - this is an example of what is known as a ""post-translational modification"". It is also quite common for the first part of a protein (including the starting methionine) to be removed during processing - an example is secreted proteins that have their signal sequences removed during secretion or membrane insertion. Methionines can also be oxidized to form chemically related residues.",Methionine,Does every polypeptide start with methionine as the first amino acid?
"The net inflow of water when the cell is placed in a hypotonic solution does not require energy. However, net inflow is not because there is room to move around. Individual water molecules move around randomly. They enter the cell because that was the direction they were traveling in. The number of water molecules is so high, that their individual random paths average out. This is why diffusion tends to keep the quantities of water on both sides equal. When there is more water on one side, there is a greater chance that more of it will leave the area of high concentration then enter it, balancing it out. However, in a hypotonic solution, there is more solute inside the cell than outside. The probability for each individual water molecule to leave the cell is greatly decreased. Therefore, there needs to be much more water inside the cell than outside, for the amount of water leaving the cell to be equal to the amount of water entering it. Until that point is reached however, the amount o f water inside the cell will increase until the cell lyses or the amount of water entering and exiting the cell equalizes.",Cell (biology),"Why doesn't the pressure of the cell (even a red blood cell that isn't rigid), balance out the net inflow?"
