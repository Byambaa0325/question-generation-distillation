"It is just the fact that Earth temperature (the timestamp when life began and persists) is not as high as 100 ^C. Speaking of atmospheric temperature. Also, the atmospheric pressure comes into a place, the temperature itself is not the only variable.",Temperature,Would that salt water need to be heated at a higher temperature before it began to evaporate?
"Electricity directly heat things up, the flow of electrons creates heat. However, the power of electricity can also be used to indirectly cool things down by inducing cooling effects. A fridge works in much the way and uses the power of electricity to power machinery that cools the objects inside of it",Refrigerator,How come the electricity(refrigerator) that can heat things up cool things down?
"'Atomic weight' is an older term and should not be used. 'Atomic mass' is the correct term if you are talking about amu/atom. 'Molecular mass' is the correct term if you are talking about amu/molecule. If you are talking about grams of the element or molecules, the term is 'molar mass' (has units of g/mol).",Atomic mass,what is the difference if atomic weight and atomic mass are not the same thing?
"NaOH does not have a pH, but an aqueous solution of NaOH does. Water contains both H+ and OH- ions. Adding NaOH increases the concentration of OH- ions and decreases the concentration of H+ ions. But there are *always* some H+ ions present, so aqueous NaOH solutions have a pH, usually between 7 and 14.",PH,How can NaOH have a pH scale?
"Fluids exert pressure in all directions. So the parts of the fluid on the left (P1) of the highlighted region are exerting a pressure on the highlighted region _from the left_. They still exert a pressure in all directions, but the only part of this pressure that is relevant is the part that is pushing the highlighted region. So when the fluid flows from right to left, the parts of the fluid on the left (P1) still exert a pressure on the highlighted region from the left. Similarly, P2 always exerts a pressure from the right because it is on the right side of the highlighted region (the section we are interested in). Whether work done is negative or positive depends on which direction the fluid is flowing and whether the work done is helping the movement or hindering it. When the fluid is moving from left to right, work done to the right is positive (as it is in the same direction as the flow) and work done to the left is negative (as it hinders the flow). When the fluid is moving from right to left, work done to the left is positive and work done to the right is negative",Pressure,Why the pressure P1 still acts to the right and P2 still acts to the left?
"If HOMO and LUMO were the same, that would imply a single pi electron (so 1/2 pi bond). If there is no pi bond to allow for conjugation, then there is no color.",Color,What will happen to the color?
"Way metabolism would be even more complicated. Just activating separating enzymes for separating signals would be consuming and robust for our brains and bodies to control. It would be energy and time-consuming and hard to switch from one to another. This way is cost-effective and time-efficient for our bodies. I will illustrate it with the example of fighting cancer. Although originally designed to inhibit a single kinase, several small molecule inhibitors target several, often related, kinases. When used to treat tumours bearing activating mutations in a single kinase, these 'promiscuous' inhibitors have shown clinical effectiveness and less toxicity than expected. This effect may stem from their capacity to inhibit several kinases in a signalling 'network'. However, another possibility is that these broad-spectrum inhibitors inhibit kinases that might be activated by subsequent mutations. Now the problem of 'complex signalling pathway' bothers researchers when choosing methodology on how to study pathways and molecules. how to use genetic manipulations to overcome these difficulties. Phenotypes generated using traditional 'knockout' techniques-which completely ablate expression of a signalling protein-represent the aggregate consequence of disrupting all functions of, and severing all communication facilitated by, that protein. In contrast, more refined 'knock-in' techniques-which insert a discrete mutation into only one region of a protein-allow controlled manipulation of specific protein functions and signal interconnections. having complex system is good because that way one signalling molecule (let's take cAMP) can shut down or turn on multiple other enzymes and cascades. That way body only makes an effort to produce the first initial second messenger. The job is done. cANP binds to many different kinases and initiates 7 different processes! Imagine if it was 'easy' and 1 molecule regulated one enzyme. The body would have to produce 7 different molecules (second messengers) for 7 different kinases.",Enzyme,"Why can't the enzyme that performs the cellular response just be immediately activated, without the need of a series of conformational protein changes?"
"No the IHD would remain the same you would still have 6 carbons and 6 hydrogens, an oxygen atom has no effect on the IHD. The IHD is 4 and you would still have 2 double bonds inside the ring counting for 2. The one double bond on the carbonyl counting for another 1 making that a total of 3, plus the ring itself equals 4.",Carbonyl group,Does carbonyl group (=O) affect the IHD?
"The more the substrate, the more the enzymatic activity because an enzyme cannot exhibit catalytic activity on the thin air.",Substrate (chemistry),Why does substrate concentration increase as enzyme-reaction increases?
The only way to increase the kinetic energy of the electrons is to increase the frequency. If the frequency remains constant. the kinetic energy is also constant. The amplitude of a wave does not affect its frequency. Two waves of different amplitude can have the same frequency.,Kinetic energy,Why does the current not increase when the kinetic energy increases?
Some molecules will speed up and some will slow down as they collide with each other or with the container walls. But with such gigantic numbers of molecules (~10^23) everything will average out if temperature stays the same and you won't see any change in the shape of the graph with time.,Graph (discrete mathematics),After a while would the graph for the same system be different?
"Concentration gradient is potential energy being converted into kientic energy. Actually, if moving dow the gradient - there is no additional energ needed, if going against - then you need additional energy. Potential energy is energy which every moelcule (object) has and potentially can convert into kinetic energy. That's why it is called potential energy. Potential energy is the latent energy in an object at rest. The actual potential energy of an object depends on its position relative to other objects. For example, a brick has more potential energy suspended off of a two-story building than it does resting on the ground. That's because the brick's relative position to the Earth gives it more energy. Two bricks next to each other don't give each other more energy though, because there is no force acting on them",Energy,Where does energy come from to maintain movement in both direction as the concentrations equalize?
"We ignore the -x in the denominator is to avoid having to solve a quadratic equation. We can always assume that x is negligible, but then we have to check that the assumption is valid. In this case, we could solve the equation without solving a quadratic. We also probably knew in advance that the -2x was not negligible",Fraction,Why don't we ingore the -x here in the denominator?
"You inhale much more oxygen than you actually use. Some of it goes to red blood cells swapping it for CO2, but most of the excess O2 is just exhaled. This is what allows CPR to work - there's still a lot of leftover oxygen in the exhaled air.",Oxygen,Does oxygen that had not been used up escape?
"One way people can tell between the redox reaction is when people see charges on the chemical equations. If the charges don't balance, people have to assume this is a redox reaction and go through specific steps to balance the equation. The electron transfer does occur in regular chemical reactions but the charges would balance on both sides.",Electron transfer,Is there no electron transfer?
"DNA doesn't change into RNA and thymine isn't converted into uracil. During transcription a copy of the information in the DNA is made in a new material RNA. RNA is synthesized from ribonucleotides composed of the nitrogenous bases, the sugar ribose, and phosphate groups. During transcription, this synthesis is guided by complementary base pairing between the ribonucleotides and the bases of one strand of the template DNA. ",Thymine,Why does only one of four nitrogenous bases change form Thymine to Uracil?
The efficiency of ligation and transformation tends to decrease with extremely large inserts. For large inserts there are different kinds of vectors (not plasmids) that can be used. For an enormous insert like you are asking about you would need to use a type of vector known as an artificial chromosome. These are specific to the type of organism in which you wish to grow the vector with insert.,Plasmid,Does the plasmid simply expand to accomodate the gene?
"Neurons are the most unique cells in our body. Some are extremely small, while others are very large. In general, neurons do not repair well. If several neurons were damaged, such as in a spinal cord injury, you already know the individual would be paralyzed and it is unlikely the individual would ever walk again. If a portion of a neuron is damaged, it may or may not be able to find and re-connect with itself. If the axon is damaged, the myelin cells such as Schwann cells form a tunnel to help direct the axon to the other portion. Never-the-less, even after several years, if you touch an area of your body that has a scar, you will realize that touch or feeling over that scar has changed and it is not as sensitive as it once was because the receptors and axons were damaged when the skin was damaged. Now, even though the skin is well healed, the nervous tissue has not healed and therefore the sense of touch is poor over that scar. Epithelial tissue and connective tissue heal well, but nervous tissue does not have the ability to divide and replace neurons that have been damaged so it does not heal well.",Neuron,How would other neurons and cells react?
"Homology is defined as the property of being descended from a common ancestor. This can apply to structures, DNA sequences, or even behaviors that can be traced back to an ancestor shared by two (or more) species. As one example, the fore limbs of all mammals (including: bat wings, whale flippers, primate arms, and the front legs of quadrupeds) are homologous - they all are variations on the front limbs of the first shrew-like mammals. Relative position within an organism is one very important piece of evidence for a structure being homologous. Another type of evidence is developmental - do the structures develop in the same way.",Homology (biology),Why are homologous structures considered similar in structure?
"Nonpolar molecules that repel the water molecules are said to be hydrophobic; molecules forming ionic or a hydrogen bond with the water molecule is said to be hydrophilic. This property of water was important for the evolution of life. Hydrophobic interaction plays the most critical role in the formation of the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and the folding of proteins and nucleic acids; therefore, hydrophobic interaction is the foundation for the existence of life. A self-assembled monolayer (SAM) is a layer of organic molecules formed spontaneously on a solid substrate. One end of the organic molecule binds to the solid surface via a covalent bond while the other endpoints outwards. Because the exposed end of the SAM determines the surface properties of the SAM modified substrate, we can alter a hydrophobic surface (a surface that expels water) into a hydrophilic surface (a surface that attracts water) by carefully selecting the SAM forming molecules.",Hydrophobe,What determines if something is hydrophobic or hydrophilic?
"Light is the same entity whether it be on earth, other planets, the sun, or millions of light years away in distant space. Light itself can be thought of as being composed of massless 'particles' called photons which have both particle and wavelike properties. It has what is known as a wave-particle duality. A good demonstration of this is Thomas Young's double slit experiment. Basically he placed a plate in front of screen with two slits (or holes) in the plate which allowed light to pass through and would be detected on the screen behind. The critical aspect was how wide he made the slits. If you make the slits wide light passes straight through and hits the areas of the screen directly opposite of the slits. This is light behaving as a particle. Now if you made the slits super narrow you observe bands of light with different intensity on the screen separated by dark spaces. The bands corresponding to places where light acting as a wave interacted with itself constructively and the dark spaces where it interacted with itself destructively. This is known as interference and its something only waves can perform. Now since he used the same light and observed both wave and particle phenomenon, we can assume that light has both a wave and particle nature to it depending on the situation. Hope that helps.",Particle,Is it in the form of particles or waves?
"Genes are found on strands of DNA, they are not themselves a strand of DNA. A gene is a sequence of base pairs that code for a specific protein, not a specific phenotypic trait as such. The various proteins interact in very complex ways to form traits. So, genes do not, strictly speaking, code for phenotypic traits. However, a specific trait might be reliant on the protein produced by one gene for some key aspect of its nature. So, while we might often say the gene for this or that trait, what is more accurate is saying the gene for the protein is involved in this or that trait. Genes, in fact, tend to be involved in multiple phenotypic traits because the protein they code for can be used in a variety of ways. Alleles are variations of genes, but they may or may not produce observable differences in some phenotypic trait. The reason is that proteins tend to be very large molecules and so a few minor changes here or there in their structure may or may not have much of an effect on their functions. So, some alleles produce proteins that produce pretty much identical phenotypic traits. Also, remember that some amino acids can be coded for by more than one codon, so some alleles merely contain different ways of coding for the same protein. But, obviously, some alleles, even with minor changes, can produce proteins that lead to significantly different traits. Eye color is not a good example because there are many genes involved in that (perhaps as many as 16 genes)",Gene,Are alleles just variations of a gene that code for the same trait but with physical differences?
"A v-shape ('bent') shape occurs when an atom has 3 attached groups, with one of those groups being a lone pair. It also occurs when an atom has 4 attached groups and 2 of those groups are lone pairs. Be careful though, these shapes are called the same name, but they have different bond angles. A general chem class might require that you know 1 lone pair = less than 120 degrees, 2 lone pairs = less than 109.5 degrees. Also, It is possible for an atom to have 5 or even 6 groups attached to it (these cases are called expanded octets), such as Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).",Lone pair,Species have lone pairs molecular geometry can only be v-shaped or trigonal pyramid?
"The activation energy just describes how much energy the reactants must have to get the reaction started. That energy is needed to help break and form bonds, but in the end it is still present. You could think of this as being similar to an amusement park where you might have to be at least 1.2 m high to get on a ride - your height isn't affected by the ride! for an 'endergonic' reaction some of the starting kinetic energy may have been converted into chemical potential energy.",Activation energy,Are activation energy counted as free energy that released or absorbed?
"During the production of reproductive cells, chromosomes of the same type (except for X & Y in the case of chromosomally typically males) line up and exchange sections of their genetic code. If the chromosomes are not lined up perfectly during this process the codes may be reversed, or one may end up with two copies of a small section of DNA while the other gets none. Mutations that start here are often called crossing over errors. These mutations are particularly important because they are automatically germline mutations (able to be passed down to future generations). There are other possible sources of mutations, but most of these will be somatic mutations (not able to be passed to future generations).",Mutation,Why do genetic mutations still exist in the gene pool?
"Muscles can get larger, and muscle cells can't divide, so if both of those things are true, *the only way to make a muscle larger is to make each individual cell larger*. Increase in cell size and increase in cell number are different processes with different names - hypertrophy and hyperplasia, respectively. In some tissues, only one of these processes can take place. In the muscle, it's hypertrophy",Muscle,How muscles grow with exercise?
"Alcohol are some of the toxins and they enter the cell by endocytosis. When a vesicle comes in contact with a membrane in the ER or Golgi body, the membrane does not wrap around it to create another membrane. Instead, the two membrane's fuse, so the contents are released into the lumen of the ER or Golgi body. Then, when the contents leave again, a new vesicle will form around them.",Vesicle (biology and chemistry),Does the vesicle have two membranes around?
"Antiport means transporting two different molecules in the same time but in opposite direction. Though sodium-potassium pump has an antiport activity, it is not considered as antiporter because it transports sodium(against its concentration gradient) and potassium(down its concentration gradient) in opposite direction but not in the same time.",Sodium–potassium pump,How is the Sodium-Potassium Pump NOT an anti porter?
"The seasons in the equator are near non-existent. The tilt of the earth's axis maintains nearly equal amounts of sunshine around this area all year round. There are, however, dry/rainy seasons, but this is caused more by the heating of the oceans and air currents carrying moisture than anything else. Typically the equatorial zone (area near the equator) is estimated at 20 degrees north and 20 degrees south of the equator. Beyond that boundary, seasons become more and more pronounced, with the poles having some of the most dramatic.",Equator,Can the hotter/cooler air in the equator change temperatures around the equator?
"Most indicators don't change color significantly after you go out of their useful range. This appears to be also true for Bromothymol Blue, which google image searching suggests just becomes a darker shade of blue as the solution gets more basic at least as far as pH 14",Color,Does the colour goes away?
"Only the valence electrons in a conductor metal atom usually are involved in the flow of current (1 to 3 out of the many electrons a metal atom has. Copper has 29). These valence electrons too are loosely bound to the nucleus and can be used for current flow easily, this is because on losing a certain number of electrons these metal atoms actually gain stability in some ways. Also, even when they participate in current flow the electrons are still there near every metal atom (a bit like water flowing in a pipe). So as a combination of all these factors it doesn't lead to instability. But yes, if you tried to extract say 10, or even 5 electrons from copper atom got them away then the copper atom would be quite unstable. ",Atom,Would not the atoms become unstable?
"The hypothesis would have to be thoroughly tested before one could undoubtedly give an answer. Since Zebra Finches' songs are partly innate and partly learned, it would have to depend on the music as well as many environmental factors. If pop or rock music were to be played to it, I doubt any of music would be implemented into its song and it could have affected the bird's mental health (and certainly not in a good way). On the other hand, many birds enjoy listening to classical music (which has positive effects on the brain), and parrots specifically, either imitate or show they enjoy it. Although the Zebra Finch would not imitate it exactly, there is the possibility that it would use patterns from the song",Bird vocalization,But the person who raised it played music would the bird learn to sing a song that is related to the music that was played as it grew up?
"Semipermeable and selectively permeable can be slightly different in meaning, though this usage is not consistent. Semipermeable is typically used as an overall term for membranes that only allow some molecules to pass through - in some cases this is used exclusively for selection based on molecule (or ion) size. Selectively permeable just means that some molecules can pass through the membrane based on their properties, but most molecules or ions can not pass through the membrane. Different semipermeable membranes may let different size molecules pass through - an example of this is dialysis membranes (or tubing), which can be made with pore sizes that will allow small macromolecules (e.g. proteins) to pass through while restricting larger macromolecules.",Cell membrane,Does selectively mean that the gap of the membrane is too small for the solute to pass by?
"The C+ cabocation took the most available electron from the next monomer. Markovnikov's rule is important in the first step, and the last step since it mainly applies to the addition of hydrogen halides to alkenes. ",Markovnikov's rule,Doesn't that violate Markovnikov's rule that the more substituted C will bond with the more substituted reactant?
"There are two double bonds between C and O, and two lone pairs of electrons on each Oxygen. During the formation of CO, what happens is the absence of the second oxygen is solved by the donation of one of those lone pairs of electrons from the oxygen to the carbon. So two of the bonds are simple covalent bonds, in which each atom supplies one electron to the bond, and the third bond is a co-ordinate covalent bond (i.e. both electrons provided only by O). Count the electrons and notice that both have 8 in their outer shell. That's is all molecules want",Oxygen,How does oxygen get a triple bond with carbon?
"Symporters and antiporters use the energy stored in the electrochemical gradient. Depending on which membrane is being discussed, the electrochemical gradient may created by either metabolic processes (e.g. the electron transport chain in mitochondria) and/or by using ATP to pump ions ""uphill"" (against their electrochemical gradient). Secondary active transport means that, rather than directly using ATP to power the movement of compounds across the membrane, proteins like symporters and antiporters use the energy stored in the electrochemical gradient. The electrochemical gradient is the combined ""push"" due to concentration and charge differences across the membrane.",Antiporter,Do the symporters and antiporters use ATP?
Electrons carry a negative charge but where is the other negative charge that repels it? Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract pairs of electrons to its itself.,Electron,Why does the electrons spend more time with oxygen as negitive repels negitive?
"Energy is being converted ultimately into heat, which is dispersed in the expanding universe. Entropy increases to a point that heat energy is no longer useful for doing any work.",Energy,How does that relate to the notion that energy can be neither created nor destroyed?
"An electron is defined by a wave function and the square of the wave function informs us of the probability of finding the electron in particular places, and this gives rise to the concept of an ""electron cloud"" which is the familiar picture of an orbital. When a bond is formed, atomic orbitals are replaced by molecular orbitals, but the ""rules"" stay the same, in that we can only refer to the probability of finding an electron at a certain position.",Electron,Can the bonded electrons get replaced by other electrons without the bond itself breaking?
"The tree of life is a metaphor for the fact that all life on earth is evolutionarily related, somewhat like a huge version of a human family tree. The tree really has nothing to do with physical characteristics such as fur or number of legs. Because evolution allows lineages to change physiologically and anatomically, many pairs of species on earth are quite different. When we look at two species whose members outwardly appear somewhat similar, this is a clue that they share a recent common ancestor. For example, dogs and horses are biologically separate lineages, however they are similar enough (four legs, fur) that it is highly likely that the two lineages split more recently, such as two first cousins who's most recent common ancestor was a grandparent. When we talk about a biological common ancestor, we really mean an ancestral species consisting of many individuals. A ""grandparent population"" that split and became two separate populations, which persisted into becoming modern day dogs and horses. On the other hand, dogs and mosquitoes are very different, which is a clue that their common ancestor diverged into the two lineages a very long time ago, like two distant cousins sharing a great great great great great great grandparent. This ancestral species probably outwardly looked nothing like either a dog or a mosquito. So the whole idea of the tree of life is to convey the idea that all living species, including dogs, horses, and mosquitoes are related, even though some are more closely related than others.",Horse,How would dogs and horses be listed?
"If you have the same number of electrons as protons, just like you would in any atom because all atoms have the same number of electrons as protons, then the charge is neutral",Electron,How do you know how many electrons that the elements start with?
"Viruses such as COVID-19 are strands of genetic material, they are covered in a protein shell. They are not living, because they cannot reproduce like humans can. Instead, they hijack healthy cells to make more and more viruses, which make the healthy cells burst.",Virus,Are virus living things?
"The brain commands it to move food into esophagus and air into trachea. When you swallow, the muscles pull up on your hyold bone and this makes the larynx up. The epiglottis blocks food from entering your trachea when you are eating. Thats why you shouldnt talk while eating.",Esophagus,How does the body know what to send down the esophagus and what to send down the trachea?
"Chloroplasts would not be able to make energy, they would be the first affected, but without energy the whole cell will suffer.",Human impact on the environment,Which part of the plant cell would be most affected?
"Nuclear energy gives more benefits to our Society than in harms us (according to Politicians and authorities). The least respected aspect of any idea in Capitalistic Society is - human health and long term negative effects on the Earth. Least paid attention to pollution. However, the problem can not be solved easily. Just 'inventing' an alternative form of energy is not enough. How to make people change their practices, premises? people are so rigid and watch everything through narrow holes. While there are many fantastic ideas, money dictates every decision. Lots of great ideas will be let in vain as long as money dictates.",Energy,Why don't we make a different source of energy?
"Increase the voltage (which means using a more powerful battery) while increasing the resistance (using a resistor made of a more insulant material. Leading to the same stream of electrons moving across the resistor Decrease the voltage, pushing the electrons less fiercely and thus decrease the resistance to make sure the number of electrons flowing remains the same.",Resistor,How do resistors decrease voltage?
"It is the activity of the liquids and solids that equals 1. The concentration of water is 55.5 mol/L. The typical concentration of a solute in a reaction is 0.1 mol/L to 1 mol/L. Even if the water is a reactant in the reaction, its concentration stays almost constant.",Liquid,Is there always one mole of the solid/liquid in every litre of the solid/liquid?
There are billions and billions of Na atoms and NH3 molecules in the reaction mixture. The Na and ammonia are always in excess. The alkyne is the limiting reactant.,Sodium,How do you know there are plenty left over after using Na with one electron already in the first step when it started off the reaction?
"the bacteria that took up the plasmid not only survived the antibiotic, but also fluoresced under UV light. That made it a lot easier to see the bacteria that took up the plasmid successfully. The only way that the bacteria would glow (and would have the resistance) is if the bacteria was transcribing the DNA and creating the proper proteins for the resistance and the glow, so if the plasmid wasn't picked up and properly transcribed and translated, it wouldn't work.",Plasmid,Is there any other antibiotic resistance gene to make the difference between the plasmids which correctly inserted the gene and the plasmids which didn't?
"Osmosis and dissolving are different processes! Dissolving is what happens when molecules or ions in a crystal (or other solid) disperse within a solution. For example, if I put salt or sugar into a cup of water it dissolves - note that there is no semi-permeable membrane involved. In contrast, osmosis is the tendency for water (or another solvent) to move across a semi-permeable membrane to decrease differences in solute concentration.",Osmosis,Salt was dissolved in the digestive system so why would osmosis need to dissolve it again when diffusing the salt?
"The Zinc and Copper technically are in direct contact through the electrodes connecting the two beakers. Both the Zinc and Copper and also the electrodes are conductors, so electron transfer and redox can occur.",Zinc,How does Zinc and Copper get oxidised?
"We are essentially the same species that lived before then. If we found a homo sapien baby from back then and raised it now, it would grow up and act just like a human baby from today. Its likely that other human subspecies would act more or less like humans as well.",Human,Why do we still call ourselves Homo sapiens?
"When both the carbon atoms have R,R or S,S configuration they will be chiral. But when they are R,S or S,R they would be achiral since one part of molecule is the mirror image of other ",Chirality (chemistry),Does that mean the molecule will not be chiral?
"The electrons are found in an area or space around the nucleus (protons and neutrons). the electrons can move more freely due to multiple bonds to other atoms. Freely moving electrons help the electricity flow through instead of stopping,transition metals are better conductors. ",Transition metal,Why best conductors are present in transition metals(silver)?
"Viruses are not living things, because they don't have the same characteristics as living thing do. So the only thing they can do is to command the cell to reproduce them, which the cell does until there are so many, the cell bursts. There are two different kinds of viral infection 'methods'. Lytic and lysogenic. Lytic is the scenario when the virus goes into the cell, rapidly reproduce itself, and burst right away. Lysogenic infection is when the virus goes into the cell, replicates itself along with the cell's DNA for even years before it breaks out and the cell bursts.",Virus,Are virus living things?
"'Strong' and 'weak' acids shouldn't be confused with higher or lower pH. What defines a strong acid is that it disassociates completely in water. What defines a weak acid is that it doesn't disassociate completely in water. For example: If a strong acid is in really low concentration(0,00001M) in one solution, and a weak acid is in relatively high concentration(1M) in another, the H+ concentration would probably be higher in the weak acid solution, and it would therefore have lower pH(despite being the weaker acid.)",PH,Can the strength of a base or acid be determined only by its starting pH?
"At physiological pH, amino acids are in a zwitterionic form, which means that the carboxylic group has lost its proton and is negatively charged, and the amino group has gained a proton and is positively charged. At lower pH, the carboxylic acid regains its proton, and at higher pH the amino group loses its excess proton. Amino acids are mainly found joined together in polymers called peptides and proteins. The amino group of one amino acid reacts with the carboxylic acid group of another, with the elimination of water. When that happens, then the properties of the polymerised amino acids depends on the nature of their side chains, which can be non-polar, basic or acidic. When ethanol dissolves in water everything dissolves, not just the hydroxyl group - the molecule doesn't break up.a_vote",Acid,Does the acidic value just depend on how the molecule is reacting?
"In this theory, RNA came first. RNA can do everything it needs to do: selfreproduce, catalyze reactions, regulate - all of which it still does today to different degrees. Since RNA is chemically relatively simple and doesn't have many different structural elements (only its 4 bases and its repeating backbone), it could be produced by natural chemical processes on some kind of matrix (which helps keeping the molecules in place so that they can get larger and larger till RNA happens). Metallic clay in shallow water is a great contender for that matrix. This is pretty uncontroversial amongst proponents of Abiogenesis, but after that point scholars are divided on what happened next - did DNA come next as more stable storage medium of information (this is most likely since DNA and RNA are closely related chemically and we know for a fact that RNA can handle DNA) or did RNA develop the ability to make proteins (also not impossible since we know for a fact that amino acids can be made by chemical processes not involving life and RNA is today heavily involved in making proteins). Once you have all three, no matter what comes first after RNA, the next threshold of complexity, the first cell, is a comparatively easy step.",RNA,Did RNA exist before cells?
"Some of them may, if the antibiotics manages to get all the way through all the membranes to the mitochondria itself (which is not an easy way). If they do get into mitochondria, it may not be a big deal since most of mitochondrial proteins are made by eucariotic cell and then transported into mitochondria, only few proteins are made by mitochondria itself. Actually it seems that some antibiotics do harm mitochondria, so these usually aren't used as long as there is some harmless alternative.",Mitochondrion,Would antibiotics have an effect on mitochondria when taken?
"Passive transport basically does not require any form of energy compared to active transport. In the case of osmosis,the water moves from areas of HIGH WATER concentration to areas of LOW WATER concentration, which makes it a form of passive transport. It uses no energy to move, it just drifts into lower concentrations of WATER. WATER not other materials, only WATER. Osmosis deals with water.",Active transport,Shouldn't osmosis technically be classified as a form of active transport?
"Stable isotopes don't have radiation. Unstable isotopes do, mostly because of the number (too high) of neutrons, which makes the nucleus unstable. As a result the nucleus, and so the atom, falls apart into different atoms. In this process radiation is released.",Radiation,How  between stable and unstable isotop differs in radiation?
"An ionic bond or a covalent bond, the metal atoms want to share electrons to gain a eight electrons in their valence ring or shell. Metallic bonds will shed their electrons and become cations ; they are shedding their electrons to share them with all the other cation metal atoms floating around in the sea of negative electrons.All the atoms in this sea of electrons are all sharing each other's electrons and because negatives are attracted to positives, it forms a strong, malleable bond.  They are mostly loosely bound because otherwise, they wouldn't have the metallic characteristics. it's just another constant in nature; metals just bond that way.  Covalent bonds and Ionic bonds both have their own unique characteristics just like metallic bonds.",Electron,Why are the electrons loosely bound?
It's drawn as a line (vs as a wedge or a dash) it is not defined as either R or S. When a chiral center is drawn with a line instead of wedges/dashes people can usually assume it means people have a racemic mixture. People could specify this by writing R/S before the name or +/- or by not indicating any specific stereochemistry.,Chirality (chemistry),Is not the methyl on carbon five a chiral center and given a priority?
"Polypeptides are polymers linked by peptide-bondings and are often called proteines. Plastic  consists of polymers,is not a polypeptide",Peptide,Are proteins and polypeptides both considered polymers?
"In eukaryotes, free ribosome's actually assemble around the mRNA then will begin reading the code. Fairly early on a certain sequence in the RNA may be recognised which causes the whole translation process to halt while the mRNA-ribosome complex is all transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum, translation will then begin again with the growing polypeptide chain entering the ER lumen. The process is known as cotranslational localisation. Generally speaking, proteins that are destined for lysosomes, membranes or to be secreted from the cell are made on the RER. Once the mRNA molecule is exported from the nucleus and is recognized by a ribosome, it will be translated initially in the cytosol. However, if the protein needs to be targeted to the ER, the first 5 to 30 amino acids will encode what's called 'Signal Peptide', which is a structure recognized by a protein called 'Signal Recognition Particle' (SRP). SRP binds signal peptide and pauses translation. SRP then facilitates docking of the ribosome to the Rough ER, after which signal peptide is cleaved off of the protein and translation continues into the lumen of the Rough ER.",Ribosome,What dictates whether or not a strand of mRNA attaches to a free-floating ribosome?
"Smooth Muscle Skeletal is voluntary, while cardiac muscle is involuntary (appears striated under the microscope; controls the heart). Smooth Muscle is involuntary as well-smooth muscle is responsible for involuntary movement such as breathing, digestion, peristalsis, and blinking. The diaphragm is responsible for breathing. When it contracts, the lungs are filled with air, and when the diaphragm relaxes, the air is forced from your lungs.",Muscle,What type of muscle is responsible for breathing?
"the geometry of the molecule is important as well, perhaps more important in certain cases. In the case of SiF4, the dipole moment of each Si-F bond will cancel each other out, as it is of tetrahedral geometry. A good example is carbon dioxide (non-polar) vs formaldehyde (polar). The dipole moment along each C=O bond in CO2 will cancel each other out since the molecule is linear. However, the dipole moment of the C=O bond and each C-H bond in CH2O will reinforce each other (trigonal planar geometry about the carbon center, with smaller H-C-H angle and larger O-C-H angles). Different texts will give different numbers. A difference in electronegativity of 1.7 means there is 50% ionic character in the bond, that's the most common number I've seen. I've also seen 2.0 given. That said it isn't foolproof, in SiF4 there is a difference in electronegativity of 2.08 and it behaves like a non polar covalent molecule would.",Chemical polarity,Is there an exact number that makes it polar or nonpolar?
alcohols are typically around 16 pKa (weak acids). A strong base is used because a weak base will not react with a weak acid. ,Base (chemistry),Why are we not reacting with a weak base?
"apes that diverged to become us must have been exposed to a new environment that was hostile to their anatomy. consider that most primates are generally at home swinging through the trees. Humans know that a few million years ago the plains of northern Africa were lush and it must have been highly forested. humans also know that humans emerged first oilman the plains of Africa. the period of time in which humans species evolved was also a time of rapid climate change. consider a population of apes that is suddenly stuck in an environment barren of trees. it's not their ideal environment, and they are suddenly vulnerable to predation. only the most innovative among them have a fair chance of survival. natural selection would favor intelligence where before it didn't matter, so there was a trend toward larger and more complex brains. because of this, mutants with more opposable thumbs had the intelligence to use them for grip and to make stone tools, thus the birth of technology.",Ape,Why did apes and humans evolve in different paths?
"Enthalpy is similar to energy. It can be thought of as energy in most cases. In all honesty, enthalpy is a broader term than energy because it accounts for pressure and volume in addition to all that energy accounts for. Its a state function of the system. Thus, it doesn't 'do' anything. Its just a quantity in a system.",Enthalpy,What does enthalpy do for the system?
"Lithium is a stronger reducing agent than all other alkali metals. This is because Lithium (do note that all this is happening in water) has a large hydration energy (because of its small size and high charge density), and this favours the formation of the Li+ cation significantly, making Li the best reducing agent in the periodic table (and amongst alkali metals).",Lithium,How come Li has more reduction potential than Na or K?
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating and an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by immune-mediated myelin and axonal damage, and chronic axonal loss attributable to the absence of myelin sheaths. with concomitant degradation of myelin, oligodendrocytes and axons, along with reactive astrogliosis and activated microglia - meaning that there is no only the problem of demzeliniyation but of hzperactive microglia. additional T-cell subsets play a prominent role in MS immunopathology: Th17 cells, CD8+ effector T cells and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. There are different mechanisms for lipid antigen uptake depending upon the antigen source and its structure such that endogenous lipids are differentially distributed in subcellular compartments and internalized lipids are transported to different endocytotic vesicles. Lipids containing alkyl chains that have multiple unsaturation sites or shorter saturated tails are trafficked to early or recycling endosomes [62]; compartments surveyed by CD1c and CD1a that present these types of lipids. Demyelinated plaques and associated astrocytic activation (gliosis) are the results of local inflammation and the major pathological characteristics of the disease.",Myelin,What happens to the myelin sheath and nodes of ranvier?
"Benzoic acid is a common name.numbering the ring because the substituent was on the benzene base, thus you start numbering the 1 carbon where the carboxylic acid functional group is attached to that benzene ring. In the commonly-named form, that carbonyl carbon is considered to be a part of the substituent and thus doesn't add to the ring numbering.",Carbon,Shouldn't you have started numbering from the carbonyl group instead of the first carbon that makes up the ring?
Acylation with a clemmensen reduction would be better because it would lead to a higher yield. the primary carbocation that would result from alkylation would be very unstable and would produce a small yield vs Acylation with C.R. .,Alkylation,Wouldn't alkylation lead to the result faster without having to remove the carbonyl?
"A neopentane molecule is the most spherical of all the pentane isomers. That means there is only one point on its surface that can contact with its neighbours. n-Hexane can snuggle up to its neighbours at many points along its length. n-Hexane will have stronger intermolecular forces than neohexane,",Neopentane,Neopentane can be considered as spherical?
"The electrons kicked back to the oxygen because when you protonated the molecule, the oxygen picked up a hydrogen, giving it a +1 charge. While silicon is okay with five bonds, oxygen is very electronegative, so it wants its electrons back. That's also why it wouldn't be the tertbutyl bond that leaves, because the bonds to silicon aren't the issue, the bonds to oxygen are. With the F added to the Si, the Si has a negative charge. It can return to neutral by kicking off bonding electrons. It happens to be the Si-O bond because oxygen is more electronegative than t-butyl. ",Electron,Why do those electrons kick back onto the oxygen?
"It was the sequence which told the polymerase to bind to the DNA. The polymerase starts at any point of the DNA and slides alongside it until it comes to a sequence which tells it to bind more to the DNA. Such sequences are called promotors. At -10 there is usually an other promotor, which causes the polymerase to bind very firm to the DNA, so that it can start its work. If it weren't there, the area of the DNA downstream the -35 DNA sequence wouldn't be transcripted. But the transcription is a requirement for the translation, which in its turn is important for the production of polypeptides",Transcription (biology),What will be the problem during transcription?
"At a very basic level, in a peroxide, the oxygen has an oxidation number of -1, where in a superoxide, the oxidation number of oxygen is -1/2. To determine whether the anion is a superoxide or peroxide, use the total oxidation number of a compound and the known oxidation numbers of other elements. For example, in KO2, we know that the oxidation number is 0, and K is +1; So we can do 1 + 2O = 0, simple algebra tells us that the oxidation number of the Oxygens is -1/2, which means it is the superoxide anion.",Superoxide,How to determine whether an oxide is superoxide or peroxide?
"You hear a sonic boom when a shock wave passes by you. Individual air particles moving faster than sound do not create a shock wave that can pass by you, just like individual molecules of water do not make a wake.",Sonic boom,Would air particles perform a tiny sonic boom?
Introns have multiple roles in biology including the regulation of gene expression. Other introns have functions after they are spliced out from the transcript and can act as signaling or regulatory molecules. Some relatively rare types of introns appear to be parasitic DNA molecules - they insert copies of themselves into genes and then splice themselves out from the RNA presumably to keep the host cell alive. It is possible that the more typical introns originated from such parasitic DNA elements. This is still an area of active research and it is quite likely that more functions for introns will be uncovered in the future.,Intron,Why are introns are formed?
"trioxidane (H2O3) is exceedingly unstable and reactive, especially in the presence of water. Even if trioxidane were formed, it would decompose into water and O almost immediately. Then, because single atoms of O are one of the most reactive known substances, the O would react with C or O2 to form either ozone, CO or CO2. However, if there is not enough oxygen available, the combustion of ethane will also produce CO (g) and C(s) instead of just CO2 and water.",Trioxidane,Why not H2O3 and C?
For an electron to jump from one energy level to another it needs the exact amount of energy. The only exception to this is when the electron is freed from the atom and then the excess energy goes into the momentum of the electron. when a hydrogen atoms electron goes from an energy state of n=6 to n=1.,Energy level,"Does it not change its position at all, or does it jump to the higher energy level, but is very unstable?"
"For all proteins mRNA first binds to a 'free' ribosome (in the cytosol, not bound to the ER). Proteins that are synthesized on the rough ER (RER) are made by ribosomes that *temporarily* attach to the surface of the RER. Those ribosomes are tethered to the ER by the growing polypeptide, which is inserted into the RER membrane. This insertion typically happens based on a sequence at the N-terminus (beginning) of some proteins called the 'signal sequence'. This sequence stops protein synthesis until the peptide and ribosome are associated with the RER. The proteins that are made at the RER end up either remaining inserted into the RER membrane or within the lumen of the RER. In either case they are typically further processed and sent elsewhere inside (or outside) the cell. Once the protein is completed it usually separates from the ribosome, which is then (usually) no longer connected to the ER. if you broke the machinery that recognizes the signal sequence, then RER synthesized proteins would stop being made. However, if you somehow just 'knocked' the ribosomes off the RER, new ribosomes with their signal sequence containing proteins would just rebind and start translating. Other proteins are synthesized on 'free' ribosomes that never attach to the ER. Synthesis of these proteins would not be directly affected.",Protein,Do cells can still synthesize the protein?
"If you want to start off with a guess for one of your mesh currents, you can do that. I recommend you start with that mesh, and then use the same direction for all the rest. Your guess (assuming it is correct) will earn you a + sign for that mesh current. The Mesh Current Method is set up as a robotic recipe for solving circuits, with the emphasis on consistency and getting the signs correct. It does not need a good guess to get the right answer. This won't take too long: solve your circuit two ways, with your guess, and with all clockwise. Notice how you get a few sign changes in the set of equations that emerge. And notice if it is easier or harder to write the terms where two mesh currents flow in one element.",Clockwise,Should we continue with our guess or let it go and use the clockwise direction for all?
"Bacteria does do most of the work but animals degrade the whale *faster*. Bacteria Breaks down the carcass slower than the animals and organisms. After the organisms get bored(in the sense), the bacteria *then* works through the whale a lot. So the whale is mostly converted into other energy, not composted by bacteria.",Bacteria,Does 'bacteria' do most of the work?
"electronegativity can be associated with ionic bonds. The reason ionic bonds occur is because of the difference in electronegativity. There is a rule which states that if the difference in electronegativity is greater than 2, then the atom with a higher electronegativity will get the electron. This is why you see non-metal tend to have a higher electronegativity, thus getting the metal's electron(s). It is this feature which allows non-metals to become anions",Electronegativity,Can electronegativity be associated with Ionic Bonds too?
"xylem keeps getting water (it is thanks to the forces not based on the real plant needs). If the plant has nowhere to let go of water in the flower pot (no hole to let go of excessive water) it keeps 'drowning'. If transpiration cannot help all the water got through the body to the leaves, then water will just stay in the plant tissues.",Plant,Why do plants die from over-watering?
The electrostatic attraction between the Na+ ions and the Cl- ions is still there. But the attractions between these ions and water molecules is greater than their attractions for each other. The ions become surrounded by a shell of water molecules and move away from the crystal and into the water.,Coulomb's law,What happens to electrostatic attraction between Na and Cl atoms?
"If people are using the Mesh Current method and people have a current source participating in one of the meshes, that current source defines that mesh current. People have to be careful with circuits that have current sources. If people have a current source participating in two meshes then the Mesh Current Method is not the best choice for solving the circuit. If people are doing the Loop Method the same answer holds. If one of people's loops passes through a current source, that defines the loop current.",Electric current,It would that be the current for the loop?
"Electrons are not made up of anything smaller. They are just electrons. Protons and neutrons are made up of smaller particles called quarks. Protons and neutrons are made up of different mixtures of quarks, so they have different properties. Yes, all protons, electrons and neutrons are the same. Except for mass (how much something 'weighs'), most of the physical and chemical properties of atoms are caused by the very complicated ways in which their electromagnetic fields interact at a microscopic level. Thus, when you mix different kinds of atoms together, you get complicated changes in their electromagnetic fields. Sometimes these are major changes, sometimes these are minor changes. When oxygen and hydrogen mix together to make water, they release a tremendous amount of energy, and you wind up with two atoms of hydrogen being held (we call that 'bonded') to one atom of oxygen. You have the same atoms, but the amount of energy they have now is much, much less and their electrical fields have radically changed. Thus, water is not much like hydrogen or oxygen, but has its own properties. A better analogy than mixing paint is mixing wheat, water, and oil (and a few minor ingredients). Think of all the things you can make with just these three things depending on how much of each you use and how you put them together. You can get dough, biscuits, noodles, pudding, breakfast cereal, glue, gravy, sauces, a variety of wheat beers, farina, etc. It all depends on how much of the components you use and just how you go about putting them together. Much the same thing happens at the microscopic level -- what you get depends on how much you have of a few basic 'ingredients' and how you go about putting them together.",Hydrogen,What are these 'parts' made out of? why changing the number of 'parts' that are supposedly the same exact things changes hydrogen into water for example?
"The entire chain cannot be classified into either. Instead, the 1st carbon with the -OH group attached is a primary alcohol because the attaching carbon is attached to one other carbon. The 2nd carbon with the -OH group attached is a secondary alcohol since the attaching carbon is connected with two other carbons.",Alcohol (chemistry),Does that make it a primary alcohol or secondary alcohol?
The lungs are functionally like a balloon that fills the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm (which is skeletal muscle) and some other muscles change the volume of the thoracic cavity this changes the pressure and causes inhalation and exhalation. What changes is what it is controlled by for voluntary functions the cerebral cortex is taking over but normally breathing centers of the medulla oblongata and pons control involuntary breathing.,Skeletal muscle,Would the lungs be an Involuntary or Voluntary muscle?
"The number of electrons leaving the metal sample will be very small in comparison with the total number of electrons in the metal. Nonetheless, I would expect that the metal would want to lose the slight positive charge it had acquired by stealing electrons from elsewhere. An analogy might be static electricity that you can build up on an inflated balloon by rubbing it - it's not a permanent charge and after a few minutes the charge is lost.",Metal,What happens to the metal after it cools down?
"Depending on the concentration of ketone, enols do form in non-polar solvent. There is no requirement for (additional) polar solvent to be involved. Enols are just as polar as ketones. Since the ketone is relatively polar, it can't be solvated by a non polar solvent. The two can't mix, so there will be no reaction.",Solvent,Can a ketone react with a nonpolar solvent of benzene?
"Hydrogen can  be considered a halogen because, like the other halogens (fluorine, chlorine, etc.), it only requires one additional electron to complete its valence shell. ",Halogen,Why does he say it can be a Halogen?
"To make it easier to follow electron movement, we usually draw all the free electron pairs and electrons on atoms. In the case of a homolytic bond breakage, the atom is left with a single electron. Thats why we show a dot on each atom. A radical is usually very reactive and likes to bond quickly. So most of the time a radical won't stay radical for a long time.",Atom,Why do we show a dot on each atom?

"Life is an emergent property -- that means a property held by the whole that is not held by the parts. The chemicals of which life is composed are neither alive nor dead, but collectively they can have the properties we call life. Emergent properties are not at all unusual. For example, cotton fibers are quite easily pulled apart, but twisted together and woven into cloth they take on an emergent property of being quite strong. Individual drops of water do not have the property of 'storm' but a lot of water can. And so it is with life. Life is an emergent property that a vast number of chemicals can sometimes take on, though the individual chemicals do not have this property.",Chemical substance,"What makes human living not dead,like other chemicals?"

The lac operon creates the enzymes required to metabolise the lactose. A presence of lactose would need the production of such enzymes.,Lactose,Shouldn't the body repress the production of more lactose to save the energy?
"That is an ionic bond because it includes a metal (Sodium). In ionic bonds, instead of sharing electrons, the atoms gain/lose electrons and become ions. In NaCl, Sodium loses one electron to achieve a full shell, and Chlorine sucks that electron in to get a full shell. Now, they both have full shells, but their charges are different. Sodium lost an electron, so it is now a Sodium 1+ ion, and Chlorine gained an electron, so it is now a Chloride 1- ion. The opposite charges attract, so then it becomes NaCl with a charge of zero.",Electron,"Why do molecules such as Sodium Chloride, which has 1 valence electron, form?"
The N-terminus of a protein is synthesized first. Each new amino acid is added by making a bond between the carboxyl group at the end of the growing polypeptide and the amino group of the amino acid that is being added.,N-terminus,Is the N-terminus or C-terminus formed first?
"Yes, you would need a molecule with a steric number of 3, but is bonded to only two atoms. An example of that would be sulfur dioxide or ozone. So if the molecule is bent then it will be so in two scenarios. Either with a steric number of 3 giving the central atom sp2 hybridization making it electronically trigonal planar, but physically bent (like in the above examples). Or with a steric number of 4 giving the central atom sp3 hybridization making it electronically tetrahedral, but physically bent (like with water). In the trigonal planar one, the electron groups are ideally 120 degrees apart from each other. But because of the lone pair making it bent, the bond angle will be slightly less for the two atoms bonded to the central carbon. Maybe around 119 degrees. In the tetrahedral one, the electrons groups are ideally 109.5 degrees apart from each other. The lone pairs will decrease that making it somewhere between 107-109 degrees between the two atoms bonded to the central atom.",Molecular geometry,"When we do have a bent molecular geometry for an atom, how do we find out the angle degrees?"
