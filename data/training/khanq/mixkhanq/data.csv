"The 2V source is just another battery. The circuit analysis methods (Node Voltage, Mesh Current) are intended to be by-the-book algorithms (recipes) for solving any circuit. If you trust the steps you don't have to think about anything else. You don't have to worry that If the 2V source points this way then I have to make sure its mesh current flows a certain direction. We started out curling both mesh currents in the clock-wise direction. When we got to the solution it turned out i2 had a negative value, indicating that the current flows out of the top of the 2V source, just like you would expect. There is no crime if you have a mesh current with a negative value. The reason we curl all the mesh currents in the same direction is to encourage correct writing of mesh equations, especially when two mesh currents flow through one resistor (the 1kohm resistor in this circuit). You get accustomed to writing that terms with a +meshcurrent and a -meshcurrent. This habit helps reduce careless sign errors. That feature is more important than trying to eliminate a negative sign from the final answer. The simplicity of Bohr's model is easy to explain to those who start studying chemistry, and while the model itself may not represent the true nature of an atom, it portrays a rather simple picture of orbits and energy levels, making the concept of those easier to understand.",NA,Shouldn't the current that gets out of it travel counterclockwise instead of clockwise like i2?,"The 2V source is just another battery.

"Resonance decreases reactivity because it increases the stability of the molecule. The reason why resonance is decreasing the reactivity of the carboxylic acid is because moving the electrons causes the carbonyl carbon to become less partially positive (which makes the carboxylic acid more stable). When you stabilize the carboxylic acid by making the carbonyl carbon less positive, you are decreasing its ability to be an electrophile in a reaction (in other words, you are making the molecule less reactive due to the increase in stability from the resonance). Reactivity and stability are two opposing concepts. The more stable a molecule is, the less it wants to react. A decrease in stability results in an increase in reactivity and an increase in stability causes a decrease in reactivity. Think of it this way: a molecule always wants to be in it's most stable form. If it's not stable, it is going to want to react in order to stabilize itself. If it's already stable, it doesn't need to react. When writing chemical reactions, a base or acid is mentioned. This is because the extra protons(H+) and the hydroxyl ions (OH-) ions have to come from somewhere. They come from the acid/base. (which can be termed as medium of the reaction: acidic medium if an acid is used and similarly, basic medium) Now, an acid provides H+ ions(more appropriately it donates H30+ ions since H+ combines with water to from H30+ ions or hydronium ions).

"The first is: glycolysis, which will happen with or without oxygen. Glycolysis, splits glucose into two pyruvate molecules. The second is: In the presence of oxygen, these pyruvate molecules are converted to two acetyl-coa molecules. These then go through the Krebs cycle, where they reduce electron carriers.

"Resistance not only depends on length, area, and type of the conductor, it also changes with temperature for some devices. In a light bulb, because the temperature increases when it is illuminated, its resistance changes. People then have three variables and the relation between the current and the potential difference no longer gives a straight line (since its gradient, the resistance, is no longer a constant). Devices whose temperature changes affect the resistance are called non-ohmic devices. the first stage would be the 'activation of amino acids'. Basically this step is before the initiation stage. During this activation of amino acids a specific amino acid and an ATP will bind to an enzyme called ""aminoacyl-tRNA synthesas"".

"there are a few compounds that include noble gasses so they can be (slightly) reactive. While almost all chemical properties are on a continuum, this can be cumbersome to express.

"It is possible to determine the probability that a single atomic nucleus will 'survive' during a given interval. This probability amounts to 50% for one half-life. In an interval twice as long (2 T) the nucleus survives only with a 25% probability (half of 50%), in an interval of three half-life periods (3 T) only with 12.5% (half of 25%), and so on.

"Waves are disturbances right? So if you consider an example of force: say you're pulling a rope in x direction and your friend is pulling it in -x direction, with equal forces. It doesn't move as the forces cancel out. Same is with a wave. 1 wave disturbance is moving the rope up the other is moving it down so if they're equal they cancel each other out. If not then you use the same principle. In case of EM waves, I think it's the electromagnetic force that causes it.

"We are explicitly calculating *bond* enthalpy - to me this suggests that we are focusing on the potential energy. However, when we calculate an enthalpy of a reaction, we are often$ talking about how much 'heat' has been released (or absorbed) and this must be due to changes in the motion of the individual molecules. So, I think we could view these calculations as describing the interconversion between potential and kinetic energies of the molecules. $note: Clearly there are many exceptions such as: Chemiluminescence, where the energy is given off as light; and ATP powering molecular motors such as kinesins. However, in these cases we just replacing heat with other forms of light and (non-heat) kinetic energy, respectively (or more likely a mix of heat and these other forms of energy).

"The entropy of a macro-system is proportional to the number of micro-states the system can be in that are compatible with the macro-state of the system. To make this notion precise, one has to specify the definition of macro-states and micro-states and how the micro-states will be counted. Sal is not providing those details here, but is speaking more qualitatively. Still, the entropy increase with either volume increase or temperature increase can be understood at this qualitative level. The micro-state of a gas is given by the location and velocity of each molecule in the gas. If the volume increases, the molecules have more locations they can be at, hence more micro-states. If the temperature increases, the molecules have more velocities with which they can move, hence more micro-states. Remember that absolute temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules, so increasing temperature increases the range of velocities the molecules are likely to have. This is an increase in the number of micro-states. First of all, habituations is not the same as imprinting (just be careful not to confuse the terms). Secondly: the interesting thing about imprinting is, that it combines innate parts with learned ones. It is innate for ducks to follow objects that move and make noises. But the ducks can't know how their mother locks exactly and have to learn a picture of her first (13-16 hours after they hatch). So sure, it is inborn for ducks to learn the picture of their mother.

Remember that absolute temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules, so increasing temperature increases the range of velocities the molecules are likely to have. This is an increase in the number of micro-states.","First of all, habituations is not the same as imprinting (just be careful not to confuse the terms). Secondly: the interesting thing about imprinting is, that it combines innate parts with learned ones. It is innate for ducks to follow objects that move and make noises. But the ducks can't know how their mother locks exactly and have to learn a picture of her first (13-16 hours after they hatch). So sure, it is inborn for ducks to learn the picture of their mother.

The speed of bonds breaking and the speed of recombination fight one another, until they are in chemical equilibrium, that is when both speeds are the same. For instance, this kind of fight also happens with evaporation inside a closed recipient. The equilibrium is reached when the number of molecules escaping from the liquid phase is the same as the number of molecules entering it.",Is there ever an instance where both the intermolecular bonds and intramolecular bonds break simultaneously?,Intermolecular force

But there are *always* some H+ ions present, so aqueous NaOH solutions have a pH, usually between 7 and 14. carbon will almost always follow the octet rule. CO isn't an exception to this.

"Atoms in the gas phase (e.g. in outer space or in high vacuum) have line spectra. However, atoms in condensed phases (solids or liquids) can have essentially continuous spectra. For example, the tungsten filaments in incandescent light bulbs give off all colours of the visible spectrum (although most of the electrical energy ends up emitted as infrared (IR) photons, explaining why tungsten filament light bulbs are only 5-10% energy efficient). The explanation comes from the band theory of the solid state: in metallic solids, the electronic energy levels of all the valence electrons form bands of zillions of energy levels packed really closely together, with the electrons essentially free to move from one to any other. All the possible transitions involve all possible frequencies, so the spectrum emitted is continuous. The band theory also explains electronic properties of semiconductors used in all popular electronics nowadays, so it is not BS. Continuous spectra do not exist and it is really a line, i.e. absorption occurs at a very specific frequency. I can explain this further: when an element absorbs light, what happens is that the electron gains this energy from the light and jumps energy levels and is now in an excited state. The reason why it is at a very specific frequency is because the electrons are in a specific electron shell, and even have a different force toward the nucleus (based on the number of protons). Therefore, 1. each atom/element has it's own unique absorption spectrum, 2. because each outer most electron all elements requires a different amount of energy to get to this excited state. Using concentrations in the Nernst equation is a simplification. In reality, what we care about is the activity. For solutions, the activity is equal to the concentration, which is why we can get away with just writing concentrations for these species.

I can explain this further: when an element absorbs light, what happens is that the electron gains this energy from the light and jumps energy levels and is now in an excited state. The reason why it is at a very specific frequency is because the electrons are in a specific electron shell, and even have a different force toward the nucleus (based on the number of protons). Therefore, 1. each atom/element has it's own unique absorption spectrum, 2. because each outer most electron all elements requires a different amount of energy to get to this excited state.","Using concentrations in the Nernst equation is a simplification. In reality, what we care about is the activity. For solutions, the activity is equal to the concentration, which is why we can get away with just writing concentrations for these species. Pure solids and liquids have an activity of 1, so we can ignore them (since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value).",Why do leave lot concentration of pure solids?,Solid
"Biological molecules are chiral; they can detect the different isomers. If people put the stereoisomers in a reaction mix of (non-biological) chiral molecules, they would react differently too.

"The lungs are functionally like a balloon that fills the thoracic cavity.

The critical aspect was how wide he made the slits. If you make the slits wide light passes straight through and hits the areas of the screen directly opposite of the slits.

"once the sodium gave up its electron to hydrogen, it has a full shell like a noble gas, meaning it doesn't want to react. The only thing left for that H to react with is another H, forming H2. Sodium is not electronegative. It is electropositive being in group one of the periodic table.  You wouldn't know for sure, but there are a couple of factors to consider. The carbons on the end (i.e. the CH3 groups) have more H's than the middle CH2 group(s), so statistically there is a higher chance of one of these H's reacting just based on numbers. Also, the CH3 groups are more accessible, so we might expect that these would react more quickly and thus dominate in kinetically controlled reactions.

"sexual reproduction evolved via natural selection. Some very primitive form of sexual reproduction (probably just sharing DNA randomly between single cells) led to greater variation in one population vs another. On a population scale, sexual reproduction clearly offers a selective advantage. The new-found variation means that the population as a whole can thrive in a wider variety of conditions because individuals are less similar to each other and the population as a whole can therefore survive in a wider variety of conditions. For example, let's say there is a population of cells that normally can survive in only dry, hot conditions. Let's say that through random mutation (which is pretty rare), one member of that population develops an allele of a gene that allows it to survive in humid conditions, and another member develops an allele of a different gene that allows it to survive in cold conditions. If the population can only reproduce asexually (i.e. by budding off clones), you would never find an individual that could survive both humidity AND cold. So, if the desert where this population of cells lives cooled AND humidified (maybe there's an ice age), none of the individuals of that asexually reproducing population would survive. BUT, if they did reproduce sexually, there could be an individual with BOTH new alleles who could survive both cold AND humidity. So in this scenario, sexual reproduction is a selective advantage over asexual reproduction. However, the original version of sexual reproduction was probably very, very simple compared to how it works in humans - remember, our version of sexual reproduction has had a ton of time to evolve its complexities.

All of these processes are important for the functioning of the cell. The Na-K pump keeps pumping the K and Na appropriately, and maintaining the concentrations overall, and hence the osmolarity of the cell. Osmolarity determines the amount of water inside the cell, which remains well-balanced because of the constant work of the Na-K pump Light is the same entity whether it be on earth, other planets, the sun, or millions of light years away in distant space. Light itself can be thought of as being composed of massless 'particles' called photons which have both particle and wavelike properties. It has what is known as a wave-particle duality. A good demonstration of this is Thomas Young's double slit experiment. Basically he placed a plate in front of screen with two slits (or holes) in the plate which allowed light to pass through and would be detected on the screen behind. The critical aspect was how wide he made the slits. If you make the slits wide light passes straight through and hits the areas of the screen directly opposite of the slits. This is light behaving as a particle. Now if you made the slits super narrow you observe bands of light with different intensity on the screen separated by dark spaces. The bands corresponding to places where light acting as a wave interacted with itself constructively and the dark spaces where it interacted with itself destructively. This is known as interference and its something only waves can perform. Now since he used the same light and observed both wave and particle phenomenon, we can assume that light has both a wave and particle nature to it depending on the situation.

"Hydrogen bonds and London dispersion forces are both examples of van der Waals forces, a general term for intermolecular interactions that do not involve covalent bonds or ions.

"There are several forces at work inside the nuclei of atoms. The electromagnetic force of the protons wants to push them away from each other.

"Sound waves never reach your brain. They reach your eardrums, where they are converted to electrical signals, which then go to your brain.

"If you look at the periodic table, you can see Cadmium (Cd) belongs to the 12th group.

"Light is refracted at a very specific angle. I won't go into the mechanics here, but in a raindrop, light in fact undergoes so much refraction it bounces back in the direction the original ray came from, which is why rainbows always appear on the opposite side of the sky as the sun. This means that if you stand with the sun directly behind you, the rays of light form a triangle between you, the observer, the raindrop the light is refracted from and a point on the ground directly ahead of you. Since raindrops will be scattered all across the sky, and you can only observe light refracted at the specific angle, the line along which the light rays travels describes an arc across the sky, and this arc is the rainbow you see. Incidentally, the angle of refraction is also the reason why you can never catch up with a rainbow. The angle, and hence the bow's apparent distance must remain constant with respect to your position. Further apart orbitals are associated with higher energy levels.

"The more the substrate, the more the enzymatic activity because an enzyme cannot exhibit catalytic activity on the thin air.

In this particular case, acetic acid usually acts as the acid (the proton donor) because it is much better acid than water.

You are right that the lone pairs on the oxygens in acetic acid could technically grab a proton from water instead of donating it.Since OH- is a strong base (much stronger than acetic acid), it would grab a proton back and hang onto it very tightly.

"In basic solution, fructose undergoes tautomeric isomerization to form a small amount of aldehyde. If we use R to represent the last four carbons of fructose, we have R-C(=O)CH2OH = R-C(OH)=CHOH = R-CH(OH)CH(=O) or fructose = an enediol = an aldehyde The Tollens reagent oxidizes the aldehyde as fast as it is formed, so the equilibrium keeps getting pulled to the right (Le Châtelier's Principle) until eventually all the fructose is oxidized. It is possible to determine the probability that a single atomic nucleus will 'survive' during a given interval. This probability amounts to 50% for one half-life.

Just think about it, apart from liquid water, how many other naturally-occurring liquids do you encounter in your daily life? However, water does have a fairly wide range of temperatures and pressures it can be a liquid in, so it does have a better chance of being a liquid than many other substances.

"The entropy of a macro-system is proportional to the number of micro-states the system can be in that are compatible with the macro-state of the system.

In the case of SiF4, the dipole moment of each Si-F bond will cancel each other out, as it is of tetrahedral geometry. A good example is carbon dioxide (non-polar) vs formaldehyde (polar). The dipole moment along each C=O bond in CO2 will cancel each other out since the molecule is linear. However, the dipole moment of the C=O bond and each C-H bond in CH2O will reinforce each other (trigonal planar geometry about the carbon center, with smaller H-C-H angle and larger O-C-H angles). Different texts will give different numbers. A difference in electronegativity of 1.7 means there is 50% ionic character in the bond, that's the most common number I've seen.

"The hydrogen bond is a weak attraction between molecules, or parts of larger molecules to each other caused by regional polarization resulting from hydrogen's very small diameter and relatively low electronegativity.

"Genes are found on strands of DNA, they are not themselves a strand of DNA. A gene is a sequence of base pairs that code for a specific protein, not a specific phenotypic trait as such. The various proteins interact in very complex ways to form traits. So, genes do not, strictly speaking, code for phenotypic traits. However, a specific trait might be reliant on the protein produced by one gene for some key aspect of its nature. So, while we might often say the gene for this or that trait, what is more accurate is saying the gene for the protein is involved in this or that trait. Genes, in fact, tend to be involved in multiple phenotypic traits because the protein they code for can be used in a variety of ways. Alleles are variations of genes, but they may or may not produce observable differences in some phenotypic trait. The reason is that proteins tend to be very large molecules and so a few minor changes here or there in their structure may or may not have much of an effect on their functions. So, some alleles produce proteins that produce pretty much identical phenotypic traits. Also, remember that some amino acids can be coded for by more than one codon, so some alleles merely contain different ways of coding for the same protein. But, obviously, some alleles, even with minor changes, can produce proteins that lead to significantly different traits.

"With what you stated I don't see a solution to the question. You have 3 possible conditions: F1 = F2, F1 > F2, F1 < F2 F1 = F2: Box wouldn't move and no work would be done. F1 > F2: Box moves right and the work by F1 is positive and the work by F2 is negative. F1 < F2: Box moves left and the work by F1 is negative and the work by F2 is positive. Since both amounts of work you have given are positive I don't see a way to solve this. If the amounts of work are only the magnitude of the work then we can work with that. The F1 magnitude of work is greater than the the F2 magnitude of work so we can assume that F1 is greater than F2. Also since F2 is opposing the movement by F1 so the F2 work is opposing the work F1 is doing so the total work is 150 - 50 = 100 J.

You have 3 possible conditions: F1 = F2, F1 > F2, F1 < F2 F1 = F2: Box wouldn't move and no work would be done. F1 > F2: Box moves right and the work by F1 is positive and the work by F2 is negative. F1 < F2: Box moves left and the work by F1 is negative and the work by F2 is positive. Since both amounts of work you have given are positive I don't see a way to solve this. If the amounts of work are only the magnitude of the work then we can work with that. The F1 magnitude of work is greater than the the F2 magnitude of work so we can assume that F1 is greater than F2. Also since F2 is opposing the movement by F1 so the F2 work is opposing the work F1 is doing so the total work is 150 - 50 = 100 J.

"Intermolecular bonds break easier, but that does not mean first. Statistically, intermolecular bonds will break more often than covalent or ionic bonds. They can both break at the same time, it is just a matter of probability. Water, for example is always evaporating, even if not boiling.

"mRNAs typically have a fairly short lifetime, but mRNAs can be (and usually are) translated multiple times. Sometimes an mRNA is even translated by multiple ribosomes simultaneously! (The structure formed when this happens is called a polysome.) One of many types of regulation that happens within cells is at the level of mRNA stability. Whether a bond is perfectly non-polar or polar depends on the electronegativity differences between the two bonded atoms. There is a spectrum that ranges from the two extremes of non-polar covalent to ionic, with covalent polar in between. Even though two bonded atoms may be different, their differences in electronegativity might be slight and thus may still be bonding with a relatively equal sharing of electrons, such is the case of carbon bonded to hydrogen. The greater the electronegativity difference, the more the bond approaches the extreme of being ionic. About NaCl, there is a huge difference in electronegativity between the two atoms and it makes sense that this bond is ionic.

You do not have to measure until half the atoms actually have decayed, but the tradition is that we use the half-life as a measure of how quickly a radioactive element decays. Snow forms when water vapor in the air turns directly into ice because it's so cold. The ice crystals grow from additional water vapor until they fall down as snow. Hail, on the other hand, is created when existing liquid rain is carried into colder areas by updrafts and freezes into a ball of ice. Because the water in many clouds is supercooled (brought past the freezing point but still in liquid form), it is easily frozen and the hail gradually grows.

If you know how many atoms you have in a sample, and you measure how many of them decay per second, it is easy to figure out how long you would have to wait before half of all the atoms have decayed. You do not have to measure until half the atoms actually have decayed, but the tradition is that we use the half-life as a measure of how quickly a radioactive element decays.","Snow forms when water vapor in the air turns directly into ice because it's so cold.

Most bonds have both ionic and covalent character and in many cases it is actually quite arbitrary to call something one or the other. HCl is a great example of this, it has a polar covalent bond as a gas - this can be expressed as the bond having a mixture of covalent and ionic character.

"Each species takes up an ecological niche. They perform certain roles, they have their own set of predators and prey, and they each perform their roles at different times. Remove a niche, and the ecosystem is disturbed.

"Intermolecular bonds break easier, but that does not mean first. Statistically, intermolecular bonds will break more often than covalent or ionic bonds. They can both break at the same time, it is just a matter of probability. Water, for example is always evaporating, even if not boiling. But, then, why no hydrogen or oxygen is observed as a product of pure water? Because water decomposes into H+ and OH- when the covalent bond breaks. The concentration of each of these ions in pure water, at 25 degree Celsius, and pressure of 1atm, is 1.0×10e−7mol/L... that is: covalent bonds are breaking all the time (self-ionization), just like intermolecular bonds (evaporation).

The equilibrium is reached when the number of molecules escaping from the liquid phase is the same as the number of molecules entering it.","An electron is defined by a wave function and the square of the wave function informs us of the probability of finding the electron in particular places, and this gives rise to the concept of an ""electron cloud"" which is the familiar picture of an orbital. When a bond is formed, atomic orbitals are replaced by molecular orbitals, but the ""rules"" stay the same, in that we can only refer to the probability of finding an electron at a certain position.",Can the bonded electrons get replaced by other electrons without the bond itself breaking?,Electron
"the nucleotide sequences will be different. However, since we're normally considering genes within the same species it's normally quite easy to determine that two genes are 'the same' (by which we mean the genes were the same in a common ancestor, but one or both have mutated since then). Often the gene will be thousands of nucleotides long, so a few base pair differences means they are still 99% identical. It could be that one gene has a large deletion or insertion, but it's still possible to find identical regions. There are various alignment tools that give you a measure of how similar two sequences are. It's possible that two alleles could have completely different sequences, but you can still see that they are the 'same' gene based on the function of the protein they encode or by their position on the genome. But remember that allele is just a human invention to make it easy to compare different genomes. It just refers to the different sequences that an organism can inherit. It could be that one allele is a single copy of a gene whereas another allele is having three copies of the gene, or no copies of that gene.

"When half the pixels are black and half are white, this is the highest entropy. The reason for this is that, if you consider every different possible arrangement of pixels that would give 50% black and 50% white, there are more possibilities for this 50/50 split than for any other percentage split. This makes the 50/50 split the most probable, and thus it has the highest entropy. some of these possibilities might look 'organized', for example a bunch of black pixels grouped together (though this arrangement is improbable).

Semipermeable is typically used as an overall term for membranes that only allow some molecules to pass through - in some cases this is used exclusively for selection based on molecule (or ion) size.

"the only way a solution can act as a buffer if it has some way of soaking up both added acid (H+) and added base (OH-). That is why a buffer needs to have significant amounts of both a weak acid AND its conjugate base. The weak acid can react with any added base to neutralize the base, and the conjugate base (which is a weak base) can react with any added acid to neutralize the acid. These reactions are how a buffer keeps the pH from changing too much when acids or bases are added. The reason why a weak acid alone is usually not a very good buffer is that by definition, weak acids don't dissociate very much in solution. So that means a weak acid solution (let's call it HA) contains mostly undissociated weak acid HA, and not much of the conjugate base, A-. So it won't be very good at soaking up added acid, and it won't make a good buffer. We can fix that by increasing the amount of A- in the solution, either by adding an external source of A- (usually by adding some salt that contains A-, perhaps NaA), or by adding some strong base like NaOH. The strong base reacts with HA to make water and A-, the conjugate base!

"To make it easier to follow electron movement, we usually draw all the free electron pairs and electrons on atoms. In the case of a homolytic bond breakage, the atom is left with a single electron.

"A small change in the DNA code, e.g. a point mutation , could result in a small or a big change, or no change at all, depending on the changes in the proteins it codes. The change can be good or bad, or both. For example, sickle cell anemia is quite a severe disease, but carrying the mutation protects against malaria. Implicit in this question is a view that light is a wave, because waves need mediums. If light were a particle, you would not need to ask this question, right? And that puzzled physicists for about 300 years, because light does things that seem particle-like (it travels without needing a medium, for example) and it does things that seem wave-like (it diffracts, refracts, polarizes).

"First, it's important to realize that mitochondria are able to create ATP because the electron transport chain creates a H+ gradient across their membrane.

Thus, when you mix different kinds of atoms together, you get complicated changes in their electromagnetic fields. Sometimes these are major changes, sometimes these are minor changes. When oxygen and hydrogen mix together to make water, they release a tremendous amount of energy, and you wind up with two atoms of hydrogen being held (we call that 'bonded') to one atom of oxygen. You have the same atoms, but the amount of energy they have now is much, much less and their electrical fields have radically changed. Thus, water is not much like hydrogen or oxygen, but has its own properties. A better analogy than mixing paint is mixing wheat, water, and oil (and a few minor ingredients). Think of all the things you can make with just these three things depending on how much of each you use and how you put them together. You can get dough, biscuits, noodles, pudding, breakfast cereal, glue, gravy, sauces, a variety of wheat beers, farina, etc. It all depends on how much of the components you use and just how you go about putting them together. Much the same thing happens at the microscopic level -- what you get depends on how much you have of a few basic 'ingredients' and how you go about putting them together.","How is it that these 3 parts (electron, proton, and neutron) can combine into different things just based on how many of these 'parts' there are?",Proton
"Velocity and kinetic energy are not the same thing. Speed is more related to kinetic energy than velocity is because kinetic energy doesn't take direction into account. The temperature (AVERAGE kinetic energy) of the system would then be S. Kinetic energy is energy of movement. if two swings are moving in opposite direction, do they then stop moving? no; so, the energy does not cancel. In fact, energy is a scalar. For covalently bonded compounds the bonded atoms do not actually have a 'charge' like ions do, but oxidation state is sort of like a way to give the atoms a charge as if they were ions.

In omnivores, the canines and back teeth (molars) will both show wear, as both are being used.

"Noble gases are elements that are at the last period of the periodic table. They are normally found as a gas at STP (273.15K or 0degree Celsius and 1 atm), which explains the gas part. Of course, noble gases can become solids and liquids at low temperatures. But not during normal conditions. For example, Mercury is the only liquid metal in the periodic table at normal conditions, however, other metals can melt and become liquids at higher temperatures. The noble part comes because the noble gases have full outer electron shells of eight electrons each. So they are satisfied with their electron configuration and do not want to share electrons with other elements including other noble gases. Which means that they are extremely nonreactive, hence the noble part of their name. So in short, noble gases are called so as they are extremely nonreactive and are gases at normal temperatures. Krypton is a noble gas, so it's outer most electron shell is full, and therefore it also has a valency of zero.

Since mass == energy (E=MC2)energy will indeed bend space time, if there is enough energy in a small enough space. However, consider the following. It requires the mass of an entire moon or planet to have an effect strong enough for you to feel. Since E=MC2 the amount of energy required to bend space the same amount (that is to have a gravitational influence that humans could detect without instruments) is unfathomable. If there's energy that dense it tends to collapse into matter. Indeed, this is what happens in our particle accelerators such as the LHC. As for black holes, they are locations in space where there is mass dense enough to bend spacetime so steeply that it would require movement faster than the speed of light to escape.

In a certain phase, such a solid, the particles can only move so much because its IMF is holding them together. At a certain point, the incoming thermal energy can't make the particles move any faster/KE can't increase because of the phase it's in. Instead, the energy is converted to phase energy and allows the particles to break free of their IMF. When the energy is converted to phase energy, you're right in that there is a tiny drop in temperature but it's replaced almost immediately when you're continuously adding energy into a substance",How the temperature can stay constant during a phase change?,Phase transition

But the internal energies of the electrons are not used (yet). Many persons don't fit on this: electric energy is not the energy of the electron: is the kinetic energy that is transformed from waterfalls (hydrelectric), thermoelectric generators, etc, that put potential energy and the potential energy difference (Volt) to electron movements. So, the machines uses that energy transforming into its uses (mechanical movement of the obturator, the digital LCD that guide you to take a best picture, etc. But the image reception occur with other source: the photossensitivity of many microLEDs with special features of transform photonic energy into voltage (potential energy diference), and that send to the microprocessor to calculate the spatial position of each microreceptiveLED, its voltage intensity to bright.",NA,How is there life in the deep ocean?,"The deep sea plants would be relying on chemical energy, which can be created by Chemoautotrophs (Chemosynthesis) bacteria living in there area to convert inorganic matter in the area into organic compounds.

"Nonpolar molecules that repel the water molecules are said to be hydrophobic; molecules forming ionic or a hydrogen bond with the water molecule is said to be hydrophilic. This property of water was important for the evolution of life. Hydrophobic interaction plays the most critical role in the formation of the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and the folding of proteins and nucleic acids; therefore, hydrophobic interaction is the foundation for the existence of life. A self-assembled monolayer (SAM) is a layer of organic molecules formed spontaneously on a solid substrate. One end of the organic molecule binds to the solid surface via a covalent bond while the other endpoints outwards. Because the exposed end of the SAM determines the surface properties of the SAM modified substrate, we can alter a hydrophobic surface (a surface that expels water) into a hydrophilic surface (a surface that attracts water) by carefully selecting the SAM forming molecules. It's drawn as a line (vs as a wedge or a dash) it is not defined as either R or S. When a chiral center is drawn with a line instead of wedges/dashes people can usually assume it means people have a racemic mixture. People could specify this by writing R/S before the name or +/- or by not indicating any specific stereochemistry.",Hydrophobe,What determines if something is hydrophobic or hydrophilic?,"Nonpolar molecules that repel the water molecules are said to be hydrophobic; molecules forming ionic or a hydrogen bond with the water molecule is said to be hydrophilic.

"The DNA fragments move through the agarose gel so they are experiencing viscous drag as they move through the gel. This viscous drag is proportional to the mass of the DNA fragment. The mass of the DNA fragment depends on the length of the DNA fragment. The longer the DNA fragment, the more atoms it contains so the more electrons it contains. The more electrons in the DNA fragment, the stronger the intermolecular london forces of attraction between the DNA fragment and the gel molecules so the greater the viscous drag experienced by the DNA fragment. They travel at the same acceleration but it's the viscous drag through the gel that causes heavier DNA fragments to move slower than the lighter DNA fragments. We cant treat light the same way we treat matter because daily things travel very slowly but when you are travelling at speeds beyond 10^6 ms^-1 the science is different matter and energy are interconvertible (e=mc^2) so it doesn't really store energy it is energy itself.",DNA,Shouldn't all the DNA fragments move with the same speed?,"The DNA fragments move through the agarose gel so they are experiencing viscous drag as they move through the gel.
