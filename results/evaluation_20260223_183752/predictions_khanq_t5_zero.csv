Which ketone does the protecting group protect?,phosphatidylinositol headgroup creates seven distinct phosphoinositide species. Ketone is highly regulated and dynamic. It is not literally like line in fact
Does the element actually change?,a positive charge. The modern way we look at what an element is by the number of protons it has. The number of protons dictates the electric charge of the atomic nucleus which in
Why does flagella is not an organelle?,is an organ as it is the only mode of locomotion and performs other functions like excretion. Flagella is an organ as it is the only mode of locomotion and performs other functions
But how would two stereoisomers not carry out the same biological reactions?,a voltage source provides (generates) whatever voltage is needed to keep the current on its terminals constant. The difference between them lies in which parameter (voltage or current) is being controlled
Where did the extra H+ come from?,"carbon 14 is constantly decaying, but it is constantly being created. Hydron (chemistry): there is a time limit on how long carbon 14 can exist. however, new supplies of it are created"
How does light travel so fast?,is the time it takes before half of the atoms in a sample of the element have decayed. half-life of a radioactive element is the time it takes before half of the
How to find the time of the average velocity?,"permeable can be slightly different in meaning, though this usage is not consistent. Semipermeable and selectively permeable can be slightly different in meaning, though this usage is not consistent."
Does metabolism vary widely between people?,. Metabolism can be defined as the sum of all of the chemical reactions occurring inside a living organism. Metabolism can be defined as the sum of all of the chemical reactions occurring inside a
What is this electrical energy converted to when I take a photo?,"energy: The deep sea plants would be relying on chemical energy, which can be created by Chemoautotrophs (Chemosynthesis) bacteria living in there area to convert inorganic matter"
Is not the methyl on carbon five a chiral center and given a priority?,(chemistry): Nonpolar molecules that repel the water molecules are said to be hydrophobic; molecules forming ionic or a hydrogen bond with the water molecule is said to be hydrophilic
How does the photon carry energy?,"agarose gel so they are experiencing viscous drag as they move through the gel. This viscous drag is proportional to the mass of the DNA fragment. The longer the DNA fragment,"
